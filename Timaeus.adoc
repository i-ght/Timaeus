Socrates

One, two, three: but pray tell me, dear Timaeus, where is the fourth among those who dined with us yesterday, and now among the hosts?

Timaeus

A certain ailment has befallen him, O Socrates; for he would not willingly have absented himself from our gathering.

Socrates

Shall it then be your duty to fill the void left by his absence, both in deed and in the discourse concerning him?

Timaeus

Indeed, it shall be so, and according to our ability, we shall leave nothing wanting; for it would not be just that those who were entertained by you yesterday should not eagerly share with the rest of us.

Socrates

Do you then remember all that you were to recount regarding the matters I set forth?

Timaeus

We remember those things, but for what we do not, you may remind us; and moreover, if it be not too burdensome for you, return to the beginning briefly, that it may be more firmly established among us.

Socrates

So be it. Yesterday, it was the essence of the discourse I delivered concerning the state that appeared to me most fitting, and from what sort of men it might best arise.

Timaeus

And indeed, it was spoken well among us, O Socrates, in accordance with reason.

Socrates

Shall we not then distinguish the various arts of the husbandmen from those of the warriors, as we first did in our discourse?

Timaeus

Yes.

Socrates

And according to nature, granting to each his own suitable pursuit, one art for each, we shall declare that those who ought to be warriors must be the guardians of the city, whether some from without or even from within should arise to do harm, judging gently those who are friends by nature and are in authority, yet fierce in battle against those who confront them from among the enemies.

Timaeus

Indeed, it shall be so.

Socrates

For I believe we have spoken of a certain nature of the guardians of the soul, that they must be both spirited and philosophical, so that they may rightly be gentle towards one another and fierce when the occasion demands.

Timaeus

Yes.

Socrates

And what of their nourishment? Should they not be nurtured in gymnastics and music, and all that pertains to them, in every respect?

Timaeus

Indeed, it shall be so.

Socrates

And those thus nurtured ought to be taught that they should not consider any possession of gold or silver or any other private wealth as their own, but rather, as hired guardians receiving a wage for their service from those whom they protect, a wage that is moderate and temperate, to be spent in common and to live together with one another, ever mindful of virtue, while allowing leisure for the other pursuits.

Timaeus

These matters have also been spoken of in this way.

Socrates

And indeed, we have also recalled concerning women, that their natures should be harmonized with those of men, and that all pursuits should be shared in common, both in war and in other aspects of life.

Timaeus

Thus it was also said.

Socrates

What then of the matter of procreation? Is it not memorable, due to the novelty of what has been said, that we have established that the matters of marriage and of children should be common to all, devising a means that none should ever know their own offspring, and that all should regard one another as of the same kin, brothers and sisters, as many as may be born within the proper age, and those who are parents and ancestors above, and those below, the children of children?

Timaeus

Yes, and these matters are indeed memorable as you say.

Socrates

And that they should be born as the best of natures, do we not remember that we said the rulers should secretly devise a lottery for the unions of marriage, so that the base may be separated from the good, and that no enmity should arise among them due to this, considering chance as the cause of their unions?

Timaeus

We do remember.

Socrates

And indeed, we have said that the good should be nurtured, while the bad should be sent to another city in secret; and as they increase, we must always seek to elevate the worthy again, while those unworthy among them should be transferred to the land of the returning.

Timaeus

So it is.

Socrates

Have we then already concluded, as we did yesterday, to return once more to the principal points, or do we still desire to discuss something further that remains unaddressed, dear Timaeus, as if it were left behind?

Timaeus

By no means, for those very matters were indeed the ones spoken of, O Socrates.

Socrates

I would fain hear what follows concerning the city we have traversed, for I find myself in a certain state akin to this: as if one, having beheld some beautiful creature, whether wrought by art or living in truth, and leading a tranquil existence, were to be seized by a desire to see it in motion, and to witness what might be fitting for it in the course of its endeavors. In like manner, I feel towards the city we have discussed. For I would gladly listen to the tales of the contests in which the city engages, striving against other cities, both in war and in the arts of warfare, rendering fitting honors to education and nourishment, according to the deeds performed and the discourses delivered to each of the cities. Thus, O Critias and Hermocrates, I have come to the conclusion that I am not capable of sufficiently praising the men and the city. And this is no wonder; but I have also received the same opinion regarding the events of old and the poets of the present, not in any way disparaging the poetic craft, but it is evident to all that the mimetic art, wherever it is nurtured, will easily and excellently imitate these things. Yet that which arises outside of its nurture is difficult to achieve in deeds, and even more so in words. As for the sophists, I consider them well-versed in many words and other fine matters, yet I fear that, being wanderers among the cities and having no proper governance, they may be unworthy companions of philosophers and statesmen, as they engage in deeds and words concerning warfare and battles. Thus, the nature of your disposition remains, partaking of both in essence and nurture. For Timaeus here, being of the most well-governed city of Locri in Italy, is not inferior in substance or lineage to any there, having been entrusted with the greatest offices and honors of the city, while in my view, he has attained the pinnacle of philosophy. As for Critias, we all know him to be no private man among those we speak of. And concerning Hermocrates, regarding nature and nurture, it is fitting to trust in the many witnesses to these matters. Therefore, yesterday, pondering your desire to discuss the city, I willingly offered my assistance, knowing that none among you would be more capable of delivering the subsequent discourse—if indeed the city were to be established in a manner fitting for war, it would alone render to itself all that is appropriate, as I now declare. Thus, having conferred together, I stand ready, adorned for this task and fully prepared to receive your words.

Hermocrates

Indeed, as Timaeus has said, O Socrates, we shall not lack in eagerness nor is there any excuse for us not to act upon these matters. For even yesterday, as soon as we arrived here at Critias’ lodging, where we are also to stay, we were already contemplating these things along the way. Thus, he has introduced to us a discourse from ancient hearsay: which you too, Critias, should now relate, that he may lend his approval to the task, whether he be fit or unfit for it.

Critias

These things must be done, if Timaeus, our third companion, agrees.

Timaeus

It seems so.

Critias

Listen then, O Socrates, to a tale that is indeed strange, yet wholly true, as Solon, the wisest of the seven, once declared. There was indeed a man, a very dear friend of ours, the grandfather of Dropides, as he himself often speaks in his poetry. To Critias, our grandfather, he said, as the elder recalled to us, that there were great and wondrous works of this city, long since vanished through time and the decay of men, yet one among them was the greatest, which now, in remembrance, it would be fitting for us to honor you and the deity at the festival, just as we might praise those who sing hymns in truth and justice.

Socrates

You speak well. But what is this work, Critias, that you do not mention, as if it were an ancient deed performed by this city, according to the account of Solon?

Critias

I shall recount, having heard an ancient tale from no recent man. For at that time, Critias, as he said, was nearly ninety years of age, while I was but a mere lad. The festival of the Cureotes was upon us, coinciding with the Apaturia. It was customary for the children to engage in contests during this festival: for our fathers had set forth competitions in recitation. Many poems were recited by various poets, and among them, we knew well the works of Solon, which were new at that time. One of my kinsmen, whether he thought so at the time or perhaps out of some favor towards Critias, declared that Solon had become the wisest of all men and, in his poetry, the most free-spirited of all poets. The elder—indeed, I remember it well—was greatly pleased and, smiling, said: ‘If, O Amynander, he did not employ his poetry in a trivial manner, but rather labored as others do, then the discourse he brought from Egypt was complete, and he was not compelled, due to the strife and other evils he encountered here, to compose it in a manner that was less than fitting. In my view, neither Hesiod nor Homer nor any other poet ever attained greater renown than he.’ ‘What was the discourse?’ said he. ‘It was concerning the greatest and most renowned of all just actions that this city performed, which, due to the passage of time and the decay of those who wrought it, has not endured here in its entirety.’ ‘Speak from the beginning,’ said he, ‘what it was, how it was, and from whom it was said to be true, as Solon declared.’

In the land of Egypt, there exists a region within the Delta, where the waters of the Nile divide, known as the Saïtic nome. In this nome lies the grand city of Sais, from whence the king Amasis hailed. The chief deity of this city is Neith, known to the Greeks as Athena; indeed, the inhabitants of Sais claim a certain kinship with the Athenians. Solon, upon visiting them, was held in high esteem, and he sought to inquire of the ancient priests, who were well-versed in such matters, about the olden times. Yet, he found no Greek, not even himself, who could speak of these things with any authority.

In his quest for knowledge, he endeavored to draw forth tales of the ancients, seeking to discuss the earliest legends, including those of Phoroneus and Niobe, and after the great flood, the stories of Deucalion and Pyrrha, as well as their descendants, and the years that had passed since those times. One of the priests, speaking with great wisdom, remarked, "O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always but children; there is no elder Greek among you." Upon hearing this, Solon inquired, "What do you mean by this?" The priest replied, "You are all young in spirit; for you possess no ancient knowledge or wisdom passed down through the ages. The reason for this is that many great destructions have befallen mankind, and more shall come, some by fire and others by water, and many other shorter calamities."

The tale told among you speaks of how once Phaethon, son of Helios, attempted to drive his father's chariot but, unable to control it, set the earth ablaze and was himself struck down by lightning. This story, while a myth, holds a kernel of truth regarding the changes that have occurred on earth over long ages, leading to great destruction by fire. Those who dwell in the mountains and high places, as well as in arid regions, are more likely to survive than those near rivers and seas. For us, the Nile serves as a savior, rescuing us from such calamities.

When the gods cleanse the earth with waters, some, like the shepherds in the mountains, are saved, while others in your cities are swept away into the sea by the rivers. In this land, neither then nor at any other time does water flow down upon the fields; rather, it is the opposite, as all water flows up from below. Thus, for these reasons, the ancient tales are preserved here, and the truth is that in all places where there is no severe winter or scorching heat, the population of mankind is always greater or lesser.

As for those tales, whether from your land or elsewhere, of great deeds or notable differences, all are inscribed in the ancient temples and preserved. What you and others have recently constructed is recorded in writing, and all cities require such records. Yet, through the passage of time, like a disease, a heavenly current has come upon you, leaving the unlettered and uneducated among you, so that you are as if reborn, knowing nothing of the ancient times, neither of your own history nor that of others.

Indeed, what has been genealogically established, O Solon, regarding your people, differs little from myths, for you remember but one great flood that occurred long before many other events. Furthermore, you do not know of the most beautiful and noble lineage that once existed in your land, from which you and your city now descend, having been left with but a remnant of that ancient seed, while you have forgotten due to the many generations that have passed without written records.

For there was a time, O Solon, when the city of the Athenians, now existing, was the greatest in valor and the most just in all matters, renowned for its splendid deeds and governance, said to be the finest of all under the heavens.

Upon hearing this, Solon expressed his astonishment and earnestly requested the priests to elaborate on the matters concerning the ancient citizens with great precision. The priest replied, "There is no envy, O Solon, but rather I speak for your sake and for the sake of your city, especially in gratitude to the goddess, who has favored and nurtured both your people and ours, having received the seed from the Earth and Hephaestus long before you, and this city in later times. In our sacred writings, the number of years recorded here amounts to eight thousand.

Now, concerning the events of the nine thousand years, I shall briefly outline the laws and the most splendid deeds accomplished by them; the precise details we shall explore further in due time, taking the writings in hand.

Consider the laws here: you will discover many examples of what existed among you then. First, the lineage of the priests is distinctly set apart from the others, followed by that of the artisans, each working independently without mingling with one another, as well as the herdsmen and the farmers. Moreover, I have perceived that the warrior class is also separated from all other lineages, with no other duties assigned to them by law except those pertaining to war.

Furthermore, their relationship to arms, such as shields and spears, is notable, for we were the first to be armed among those concerning Asia, as the goddess had indicated in those places among you. As for wisdom, you can see how much care the law has taken from the very beginning regarding the cosmos, encompassing everything from divination to medicine for the health of mankind, acquiring all other subjects that follow.

Thus, the goddess, having adorned and organized all these things, settled you in a chosen place where you were born, observing the temperate seasons therein, knowing that you would be the wisest of men. Therefore, being both warlike and philosophical, the goddess selected the most suitable men to inhabit this place and established them first.

You dwell under such laws and are even more favorably governed than all other peoples, surpassing them in virtue, as is fitting for beings born of and educated by the gods. Many of your great works are inscribed here in the city, yet one stands out above all in size and virtue: for it is written that your city once halted a power that was advancing in hubris against all of Europe and Asia, having surged forth from the Atlantic Sea.

At that time, the sea was navigable; for there was an island at the mouth of the strait, which you call the Pillars of Hercules, and that island was larger than Libya and Asia combined, from which travelers could embark to the other islands and from those islands to the entire continent surrounding that true sea.

Thus, all that we speak of within the strait appears to have a narrow harbor for entry; yet that sea, truly, would be rightly called a continent. In that island of Atlantis, there arose a great and wondrous power of kings, ruling over the entire island and many other islands and parts of the continent, extending their dominion as far as Libya, up to Egypt, and as far as Europe, to Tyrrhenia.

This entire power, having gathered into one, once attempted to enslave all the lands both yours and ours and all that lay within the strait. At that time, O Solon, the might of your city became manifest to all men in virtue and strength: for it stood firm against all dangers, leading the Greeks in valor and arts of war.

In the days of yore, when the Greeks stood as leaders, and the rest, having been compelled to withdraw, found themselves in dire straits, they faced the gravest of dangers. Yet, through valor and fortitude, they erected a trophy of victory against their foes, preventing those who had not yet been enslaved from falling into bondage. As for the rest of us who dwell within the bounds of the Pillars of Hercules, we were granted freedom in abundance.

However, in the course of time, after great earthquakes and devastating floods had come to pass, a day and night of great hardship descended upon us. On that fateful occasion, all the valiant forces that you possessed were swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis itself sank beneath the waves, vanishing from sight. Thus, even now, the sea there remains a place of mystery and despair, a treacherous expanse of mud, where the island once stood proud and resolute.

Indeed, Socrates, what has been said by the ancient Critias, as you have heard from the accounts of Solon, is quite remarkable. As I listened yesterday to your discourse on the state and the men you spoke of, I found myself marveling, recalling the very things I now express, and realizing that by some divine fortune, I have not strayed far from the many points Solon made. However, I did not wish to speak immediately, for my memory was not sufficiently clear.

I thus concluded that it would be necessary for me to gather my thoughts thoroughly before addressing you. Therefore, I hastily acknowledged the matters you presented yesterday, believing it to be of utmost importance to propose a discourse fitting to our intentions, which would, in moderation, lead us to prosperity.

So, as he stated, I departed from here yesterday, reflecting on these matters, and upon returning, I endeavored to recall everything from the night. Indeed, as you know, the teachings of children hold a remarkable significance. For what I heard yesterday, I cannot say if I could recall it all perfectly; yet, those things I have heard over many years would surely astonish me if I were to escape their grasp.

It was with great pleasure and youthful delight that I listened then, as the elder eagerly taught me, often prompting me with questions, so that the impressions became as indelible as the marks of an unwashable inscription. And indeed, I spoke of these matters early this morning, so that they might flow easily in conversation with you.

Now, therefore, for the sake of all that has been said, I am ready to speak, Socrates, not only in summary but as I have heard it in detail. As for the citizens and the city you described to us yesterday as if in a myth, we shall now bring forth the truth, establishing that this city indeed exists, and those citizens we shall declare to be our true ancestors, as the priest mentioned.

Certainly, we shall align our accounts and shall not deviate, asserting that they are those who existed in that time. Collectively, we shall strive to present what is fitting to the best of our abilities, as you have commanded us to deliver. Therefore, it is necessary, Socrates, to consider whether this discourse aligns with our understanding, or if we should seek another in its place.

Socrates:

And who, dear Critias, should we rather take as our guide in this matter, one who would be most fitting to speak of the present sacrifice to the deity, given its significance, and to provide not a fabricated myth but a true account? For how else shall we discover others if we abandon these? It is not possible; rather, we must speak of you, while I, in place of yesterday's discourse, shall now listen in silence.

Critias:

Consider, then, the arrangement we have made regarding the foreign matters, Socrates, as we have set them forth. For it seemed to us that Timaeus, being the most knowledgeable among us in astronomy and having crafted a work concerning the nature of the universe, should begin by speaking of the creation of the cosmos and conclude with the nature of humanity. Following him, I, having received from him the account of how humans came to be through his discourse, shall present those who have been educated by you, differing from them in various respects, and according to the words and laws of Solon, we shall introduce them as judges, making citizens of this city, as they were the Athenians of that time, whom the sacred writings have declared to be obscure. The remaining matters shall pertain to the citizens and the Athenians, as we shall now speak of them.

Socrates:

It seems fitting and splendid that the hearth of our discourse should be thus established. Therefore, it is your task to speak next, Timaeus, as it appears, calling upon the gods in accordance with the law.

Timaeus:

But, Socrates, indeed all those who partake, even slightly, in wisdom, always call upon the gods in every endeavor, whether great or small. As for us, who are about to craft the discourse concerning the whole, whether it is noble or ignoble, if we do not entirely deviate from the truth, we must necessarily invoke the gods and goddesses, praying to them with reason, especially for those matters, while we shall speak in accordance with our own understanding. And let the matters concerning the gods be thus invoked; as for our own, we shall call upon you in the manner that you may learn most easily, while I shall endeavor to indicate what I consider most fitting regarding the subjects at hand.

It is, then, my belief that we must first distinguish these matters: what is that which is always being, yet has no genesis, and what is that which is always becoming, yet is never truly being? The former can be comprehended through reason, always existing in the same state, while the latter is perceived through sensation, subject to opinion, ever becoming and perishing, but never truly existing.

Moreover, everything that comes into being must necessarily arise from some cause; for it is impossible for anything to come into existence without a cause. Therefore, whatever the creator looks upon, aiming to maintain the same state, must necessarily take as a model something that is eternal and unchanging, thus producing beauty. Conversely, whatever is brought into existence, if it is modeled after something that is transient, cannot be considered beautiful.

Now, the whole universe—whether we call it the cosmos or by any other name that might be most fitting—let us first examine it, considering what underlies all things. We must inquire whether it has always existed, having no beginning of generation, or whether it has come into being, starting from some origin. It has indeed come into being, for it is visible, tangible, and possesses a body; all such things are perceptible, and those that are perceptible are subject to opinion and are seen as becoming and generated.

Thus, we assert that whatever has come into being must necessarily arise from some cause. It is impossible to identify the creator and father of this whole without acknowledging that it is difficult to define. We must also consider which of the models the creator employed in crafting it—whether he aimed at the eternal and unchanging or at the transient. If this world is beautiful and the creator is good, it is evident that he looked toward the eternal; but if it is not, then it must be modeled after the transient.

It is clear that the eternal is the most evident, for the most beautiful of all that has come into being is the best of all causes. Thus, having been generated, it is comprehensible through reason and thought, and it has been created in a state of permanence. Given these conditions, it is necessary that this world be an image of something.

It is of utmost importance to begin with the nature of the original cause. Therefore, we must define both the image and the model itself, so that the discourses, which are their interpreters, may be seen as related. The former is permanent, stable, and manifest through reason—unchanging and indestructible, as far as it is possible for it to be so, and it must lack nothing. The latter, however, is modeled after that which is, and is an image of it, existing in accordance with those principles: that which pertains to generation is substance, while that which pertains to belief is truth.

Therefore, Socrates, if we are unable to fully comprehend the many matters concerning the gods and the generation of the universe, do not be surprised if we cannot provide you with perfectly precise and agreed-upon accounts. However, if we do not fall short in our representations, we must love the truth, remembering that we, the judges, possess a human nature, and thus, regarding these matters, it is fitting for us to accept the plausible myth without seeking anything further.

Socrates:

Excellent, Timaeus. Indeed, we must accept your introduction wholeheartedly. Now, please proceed to elaborate on the law.

Timaeus:

Let us speak, then, of the reason for the generation of this whole cosmos that the creator has established. He was good, and no one ever feels envy toward that which is good. Therefore, being outside of this goodness, he desired that all things should become as similar to himself as possible. This desire for the generation of the cosmos is, indeed, the most authoritative beginning that wise men might accept.

For the deity, wishing for all things to be good and for nothing to be base, took all that was visible and, instead of allowing it to remain in chaotic motion, brought it into order from disorder, believing that this would be better. It is fitting that the best should do nothing but the most beautiful. Thus, reasoning through this, he found that among all the visible things, nothing could be more beautiful than a whole that possesses reason. Yet, reason cannot exist without a soul.

Through this reasoning, he established the mind within the soul and the soul within the body, creating the whole in such a way that it would be the most beautiful and the best work. Therefore, according to this reasoning, we must say that this cosmos is a living being, endowed with soul and reason, brought into existence through the providence of the deity.

Now, having established this, we must next discuss to which of the living beings the creator has made it similar. Let us not assign any of the parts to any particular kind, for nothing that is incomplete could ever be considered beautiful. However, among the other living beings, let us assert that this one is most similar to the whole. For all intelligible living beings contain within themselves that which the cosmos has established, just as this cosmos encompasses all other visible beings.

Thus, desiring to make this living being the most beautiful and most perfect, the deity created it as a single visible entity, containing within itself all those beings that are naturally akin to it. Therefore, should we rightly call it one universe, or would it be more correct to say that there are many and infinite ones? It is one, if it is to be created according to the model. For that which contains all intelligible beings cannot be second to another; for it would then have to be another living being, of which it would be a part, and it could no longer be said to be that which contains all.

Thus, in order for this to be similar to the complete living being, the creator made not two nor countless worlds, but this one, unique and singular universe, which has come into being and will continue to be.

The generated being must indeed be corporeal, visible, and tangible. Without the element of fire, nothing could ever be seen, nor could anything be tangible without some solid substance, and solid matter cannot exist without earth. Thus, the deity fashioned the body of the cosmos from fire and earth.

It is not possible for two things to be beautifully constituted without a third to bind them together; for there must be some kind of bond that brings both together. The most beautiful bond is that which makes itself and the things joined to it as one as possible, and this is naturally the most harmonious. Whenever there are three numbers, whether in volumes or powers, if the middle one is such that it is to the first as the first is to the last, and again, the last to the middle and the middle to the first, then the middle becomes both first and last, while the last and the first become both middle. Thus, it follows that all these must necessarily be the same, and whatever has come into being will be one with respect to each other.

If, therefore, the body of the cosmos were flat and had no depth, a single middle would suffice to connect both itself and the other parts. But now, since it must be solid, it cannot be one; rather, two must always be joined by a middle. Thus, the deity placed water and air in the middle of fire and earth, arranging them in such a way as was possible according to the same reasoning: that fire relates to air, air to water, and water to earth. He thus created a visible and tangible heaven.

From these elements, and through the number four, the body of the cosmos was generated through a harmonious relationship, possessing a friendship among them, so that they might come together into one, unbroken by anything else except by the bond that unites them.

Each of the four elements contributed one whole to the composition of the cosmos. For the creator established it from fire, water, air, and earth, leaving no part or power outside of these. He thought it necessary that it should be a complete living being made from complete parts, and that it should be one, as nothing should be left out from which another such being could arise. Furthermore, he aimed for it to be ageless and free from disease, recognizing that a composite body, surrounded by strong forces, would be subject to decay and illness, leading to aging and decline.

Thus, through this reasoning and the logic behind it, he created one whole from all, perfect, ageless, and free from disease. He gave it a form that was appropriate and related. For a living being that is to contain all within itself, it would be fitting for it to have a shape that encompasses all forms. Therefore, he fashioned it as a sphere, equidistant from the center to all its extremities, making it circular, the most complete and similar shape to itself, believing it to be the most beautiful of all shapes.

Thus, everything outside of it was made smooth and round for the sake of many. For it needed no eyes, as nothing visible remained outside of it, nor ears, for there was nothing to be heard. There was no breath surrounding it that required inhalation, nor was there any need for an organ to receive nourishment or to expel waste. It did not lack anything from outside—indeed, it provided its own nourishment, experiencing everything within itself and through itself, having come into being through art. The creator believed that it would be better for it to be self-sufficient than to depend on others.

As for hands, there was no need for it to grasp or defend itself; he thought it unnecessary to attach them. Nor was there any need for feet or any service related to standing. For he assigned it its own natural motion, particularly the seven movements related to mind and reason. Therefore, he caused it to move in a circular motion, revolving around itself, eliminating all other movements and crafting it to be unerring. Thus, in this cycle, it was born without the need for feet, being self-sufficient and complete.

Verily, this is the reasoning of the divine, ever present and eternal, concerning the God that shall one day come to be. Thus, He conceived a being that is smooth and even, equal and whole in every aspect, fashioned from perfect bodies. He placed the soul in its very center, extending it throughout, and enveloped the body from without, establishing a singular, solitary heaven that revolves in a circle. By virtue of His excellence, He was able to unite with Himself, lacking the need for any other, and thus He became known and beloved unto Himself. Through all these things, He brought forth a most blessed God.

As for the soul, we do not now endeavor to speak of it as we do in later times; rather, the divine fashioned a newer soul— for it would not have permitted an elder to be governed by a younger. Yet, in our great participation in what is present, we speak in this manner, while He, in both generation and virtue, established a soul that is prior and elder, as the master and ruler of the body, from which all things commence.

From the indivisible and ever-constant essence, and the essence that is divisible concerning bodies, He blended a third kind of essence in the midst, combining the nature of the one and that of the other. Thus, He constituted them according to the same principles, within the realm of the indivisible and the divisible concerning bodies. Taking these three essences, He fused them into one singular form, harmonizing the disparate nature into a unified whole by force.

Having mingled with the essence and formed one from three, He then apportioned this entirety into the various fates that were fitting, each one being a mixture of the same, the other, and the essence. He began to divide in this manner: first, He took one portion from all, then He removed a double portion of that, and the third was a half of the second, thrice the first, the fourth being double the second, the fifth thrice the third, the sixth being eight times the first, and the seventh being twenty-seven times the first. After this, He filled in the doubled and tripled intervals, cutting portions from beyond and placing them in between, so that in each interval there were two means, one exceeding the ends and the other equal in number.

Thus, with the means of halves, thirds, and sixths being formed from these bonds in the previous intervals, the entirety of the triplet was filled in by the sixth interval, leaving each portion of that interval with a count of six, fifty, and two hundred, in relation to three, forty, and two hundred. And thus, the mixture from which these were cut was now wholly consumed. Therefore, this entire composition, having been split in twain along its length, was bent into one circle, as if a hand had pressed upon it, joining itself and one another in the direct opposition of the impact, and in the same manner, it moved around itself, creating the outer and inner circles.

Thus, the outer motion was declared to be of the same nature, while the inner was of another. The outer was guided along the side to the right, while the inner traversed the diameter to the left, granting strength to the motion of the same and similar nature. For He allowed it to remain undivided, while the inner was split into seven unequal circles according to the dimensions of the double and triple intervals, each being three in number, directing the circles in opposition to one another, yet moving three alike, while the four moved differently in relation to the three, all carried forth in reason.

When, therefore, all the constitution of the soul came to be through the mind of the Creator, thereafter all that is corporeal was extended within it, and gathering the center in the midst, He fitted it together. The soul, having been woven from the center to the outermost heaven, enveloped it in a circular form, and while revolving within itself, it commenced a divine principle of an everlasting and rational life throughout all time. Thus, the body became a visible heaven, while the soul remained invisible, partaking of reason and harmony, becoming the finest of all that is generated by the best of the intelligible beings.

For, being composed of the same and the other nature, and from these three essences, it was bound by fate, and according to reason, it was divided and connected. The soul, revolving towards itself, when it touches something that is scattered, and when it is indivisible, speaks, moving through all of itself, whenever it is the same and whenever it is different, concerning what it is most of all, and where, and how, and when it happens, according to the occurrences, each being and suffering in relation to those that are the same.

The discourse that arises from the same is true, concerning both the other being and the same, carried forth in the moving being by itself, without sound or echo. When it pertains to the sensible, and the circle of the other is upright, it proclaims throughout its entire soul, and thus beliefs and opinions become firm and true. But when it pertains to the rational, and the circle of the same is well-rounded, it necessarily results in intellect and knowledge. In this way, when beings come into existence, if anyone should speak of anything other than the soul, it would declare all the more that which is true.

As it was moved and living, the father who begot it perceived it as a statue of the eternal gods, and he was filled with joy and delight, conceiving yet again to create something more akin to the original model. Thus, as it happens to be an eternal living being, so too did he endeavor to bring forth this whole into a similar power. The nature of the living being was indeed eternal, and it was not possible for the creator to attach it wholly to himself; yet, he conceived to create a movable being of eternity, and while adorning the heavens, he made a lasting image of eternity, which we have named time.

For days and nights and months and years, which did not exist before the heavens came to be, were then brought into being along with them, as they were established. All these are parts of time, and that which was, that which is, and that which shall be, are forms that we carry, yet we do not rightly perceive them in relation to the eternal essence. For we say that it was, it is, and it shall be, yet only that which is pertains to the true discourse; that which was and that which shall be ought to be spoken of concerning the generation in time— for there are movements, and that which always remains the same does not pertain to becoming older or younger through time, nor does it ever come to be or has ever been, nor shall it ever be again. All that pertains to generation is not attached to those in sensation, but rather these things have come to be as time mimics eternity and revolves according to number— and in addition to these, there are such matters as that which has come to be is indeed that which has come to be, and that which is becoming is indeed becoming, and that which shall come to be is indeed to come to be, and that which is not is indeed not. Of these, we speak nothing precise.

Concerning these matters, it would not be fitting to take the time to elaborate in the present moment.

Thus, time came to be alongside the heavens, that they might be born together and, should there ever be a dissolution, they might also be released together. This was in accordance with the model of eternal nature, so that it might be most similar to it in power; for indeed, the model is the essence of all eternity, while time itself has come to be, exists, and shall be through its end.

From the divine reason and thought, such as this, time was generated, and thus the sun, the moon, and five other stars, known as wandering bodies, were created for the purpose of defining and safeguarding the numbers of time. The Creator fashioned the bodies of each of these celestial beings and set them into their respective orbits, which the other bodies were to traverse. There are seven in total: the moon in the first orbit around the earth, the sun in the second above the earth, and the morning star along with the sacred Hermes, moving swiftly in a circle equal to that of the sun, while the opposing force was held by it. Hence, they both encompass and are encompassed by one another— the sun, Hermes, and the morning star.

As for the others, for which reasons they were established, if one were to examine all, the discourse would be more than sufficient to provide an account of the reasons for their existence. These matters, therefore, might well be recounted later in due course. When each had arrived at its fitting orbit, as was necessary for the workings of time, living beings were born, bound by the ties of life, and they learned what was commanded. Thus, in the course of the other orbit, which was lateral, through the same orbit that was moving and holding, the greater of them moved in one circle, while the lesser moved in another, the lesser moving more swiftly, while the greater moved more slowly.

In the same orbit, those moving most swiftly appeared to be overtaken by those moving more slowly; for all their circles, turning in a spiral, advanced in opposite directions, while the slowest departed from itself most swiftly, revealing itself closest to the fastest. To serve as a clear measure of the relative slowness and swiftness, and concerning the eight orbits, the deity kindled light in the second of the orbits towards the earth, which we now call the sun, so that it might illuminate the heavens as much as possible, sharing the number of living beings that were fitting, having learned from the same and similar orbit.

Thus, night and day came to be, through this, as the period of the one and most rational revolution. When the moon, having completed its own circle, overtakes the sun, it marks the year whenever the sun completes its own circle. Yet, the periods of the other celestial bodies are not well understood by men, save for a few among the many, who neither name them nor measure them against one another, seeking to understand them through numbers. Thus, to speak plainly, they do not know the time of their wandering, being filled with multitude and wondrously adorned. Nevertheless, it is still possible to perceive that the perfect number of time fulfills the complete year when all eight periods, having been combined, attain the head of the circle of the same and similar motion.

For these reasons, the stars were born, traversing the heavens, so that they might be as similar as possible to the perfect and intelligible living being, in imitation of the nature of eternity.

And thus, all else had already been fashioned until the generation of time into a likeness of that which was to be represented, yet not all living beings had yet been contained within itself; it still held some dissimilarity. This remnant was being shaped towards the nature of the archetype. Just as the mind perceives the ideas of what constitutes a living being, so too did it conceive that there should be such and so many forms.

Indeed, there are four kinds: one is the celestial race of the gods, another is the winged and aerial, the third is the aquatic form, and the fourth is the terrestrial and land-dwelling. The divine essence was fashioned primarily from fire, so that it might be the brightest and fairest to behold. In all things, it was made to resemble the perfect circle, placing it in accordance with the highest wisdom, surrounding the heavens with a true cosmos, adorned in its entirety.

To each, it assigned two motions: one, in the same manner, revolving around itself, always contemplating the same things; the other, moving forward, held by the same and similar orbit. The five motions were made stationary and fixed, so that each might become as excellent as possible. From this cause arose the unerring celestial beings, divine and eternal, always revolving in the same manner: while those that wander and hold such a course, as previously mentioned, came to be in accordance with those.

The earth, our nurturing mother, was stretched around the axis that is ever-present, and the Creator devised it as a guardian and maker of both night and day, the first and eldest of the gods that have come to be within the heavens. These beings dance and mirror one another, and concerning the revolutions of the circles among themselves, in their interconnections, how the gods are born from one another and how many face each other, with whom they cover one another in time, each being concealed and then reappearing, sending forth fears and signs of what shall come to be to those unable to reason, for to speak of these imitations without sight would be a vain toil. But let these matters, and those concerning the visible and generated gods, have their conclusion in nature.

As for the other spirits, to speak of and to know their generation is greater than concerning ourselves; we must trust the words spoken before, for they are said to be offspring of the gods, and surely they know their own ancestors. Therefore, it is impossible to disbelieve the children of the gods, even though they speak without images and necessary proofs, but as if they were speaking of their own kin, we ought to believe them in accordance with the law. Thus, let the generation of these gods be spoken of and known to us.

From Earth and Heaven were born Oceanus and Tethys, and from them came Phorcys, Cronus, Rhea, and all those who followed after. From Cronus and Rhea came Zeus, Hera, and all those known as their brothers, as well as others born of them. Since all those who wander openly and those who appear as they wish have held a generation of the gods, this one who has generated all things speaks thus to them:

"O gods of gods, of whom I am the creator and father of works, through me have all things come into being, unbreakable, even against my will. Therefore, all that is bound is indeed unbound, and that which is well-ordered and possesses harmony desires to be loosed from evil: for this reason, you have come into existence. You are not immortal nor entirely unbreakable; indeed, you shall not be freed nor shall you escape the fate of death, for you have received a greater bond and a more authoritative dominion than those to whom you were bound at your coming into being.

Now, what I say to you, I declare for your understanding: there remain three mortal kinds that are ungenerated; without these, the heavens shall be incomplete, for all living beings shall not exist within themselves, and it is necessary that they come to completion. Through me, these things have come into being, and having partaken of life, you may be likened to the gods. Therefore, in order that mortals may exist and that all this may truly be, turn yourselves by nature towards the creation of living beings, imitating my power concerning your own generation.

As far as it is fitting for you to be called immortal, let it be said that you are divine, and let it be your guiding principle to follow the eternal laws of justice and to willingly adhere to them. I shall deliver to you the spirals and the essence of existence; the rest, you shall labor to create living beings, and by providing sustenance, you shall nurture them and receive them again as they fade away."

Thus he spoke, and again he approached the previous mixing bowl, in which he mingled the soul of the universe, pouring forth the remnants of what had come before, mixing them in a manner somewhat similar, yet no longer pure in the same way, but rather second and third. Having established the whole, he divided the souls equally among the stars, assigning each to its respective star, and having imbued them as if into a vessel, he revealed the nature of the universe, declaring the ordained laws that the first generation should be one and the same for all, so that none might be diminished by him.

He scattered them into their appropriate forms, each to produce the most divine of living beings, and since the nature of humanity is dual, the greater kind shall be that which is later called man. Whenever they are inevitably implanted in bodies, one shall approach, and the other shall depart from their bodies; first, it is necessary that a single sensation arises from violent experiences, and second, that a mixture of pleasure and pain gives rise to desire, alongside fear and spirit, as well as all that follows them and all that is naturally opposed to them. If they should prevail, they shall live justly; but if they are overcome by injustice, they shall suffer.

He who lives well during the appropriate time shall return to the dwelling of the star governed by law, and shall possess a happy and customary life. But if he should fall into the nature of a woman in the second generation, not ceasing from these evils, in a manner that he might become corrupted, he shall always transform into a beastly nature, changing without ending his sufferings, until he is drawn into the same and similar cycle of existence, being caught up in the multitude and later being joined from fire, water, air, and earth, being tumultuous and irrational, yet by reason he shall strive to return to the form of the first and best state of being.

Having established all these arrangements, so that each individual might be blameless for their subsequent evils, he scattered some into the earth, some into the moon, and others into all the other instruments of time. After the sowing, he entrusted to the young gods the task of shaping mortal bodies, and as much as was still necessary for the human soul to be added, this and all that followed shall be governed by them, and according to their power, that the mortal creature may be governed in the best and most excellent manner, so that it may not become the cause of its own evils.

And he, having arranged all these things, remained in his own manner of being. As he remained, the children, understanding the order of their father, obeyed it, and taking an immortal beginning for a mortal creature, imitating their own creator, they borrowed elements from fire, earth, water, and air from the cosmos, as if to be returned again. They combined the received elements into one, not binding them with the unbreakable bonds to which they themselves were held, but rather, through their smallness, they fused them with invisible, dense joints, crafting each body from all. They enclosed the cycles of the immortal soul within a flowing and unyielding body.

The bodies, being cast into a river, neither held nor were held, but were carried away by force, so that the whole creature moved, disorderly, wherever it happened to go, without reason, possessing all six movements: for it moved forward and backward, and again to the right and left, upward and downward, wandering in all six directions. For the overwhelming and flowing wave that provided nourishment created an even greater tumult from the afflictions that befell each one, whenever a body collided with something foreign, whether it be a solid mass of earth or slippery waters, or if it were seized by the breath of winds carried by the air. Through all these, the movements would strike upon the soul, which later came to be called sensations, and even now they are still referred to as such.

And indeed, at that time, they provided the greatest and most significant movement, stirring with the flowing current, violently shaking the cycles of the soul. One cycle was entirely bound, flowing against it, while the other was shaken, so that the distances of the double and triple were established for each, as well as the mediations and connections of the half and the third. Since they were entirely unbreakable except by the binding force, they turned all rotations, creating all divisions and dissolutions of the circles in every possible way, so that they could hardly be carried along with one another, yet they were carried without reason, sometimes opposing, at other times sideways, and sometimes upside down.

For instance, when someone lies on their back, resting their head upon the ground, and raises their feet towards something, in that very affliction, both the sufferer and the onlookers perceive the right as left and the left as right, each seeing the other's perspective. The same holds true for such movements suffering intensely, whenever they encounter something of the same kind from without or something of the other kind; then they call one another both the same and the other, naming the opposites of the truths as false and foolish, and in them, no cycle is in command nor is there a leader.

But whenever certain sensations from without are carried and fall upon them, they seem to hold the entirety of the soul's essence. And through all these afflictions, the soul becomes first, when it is bound into a mortal body. When the flow of nourishment and growth diminishes, the cycles, having received tranquility, proceed along their own path and become more established as time advances. Then, already, as they move according to nature, the cycles direct themselves, calling the other and the same by their proper names, producing a rational being who possesses them.

If, therefore, one should also partake of the right nourishment of education, becoming wholly healthy, avoiding the greatest disease, they become complete; but if they neglect, they traverse a life that is crippled, returning incomplete and foolish to Hades. These things indeed happen afterward; but concerning those now presented, it is necessary to examine more closely the matters regarding bodies in parts of generation and concerning the soul, through which the causes and providence of the gods have come to be, especially for those who are most likely to hold on to these things, thus they must also proceed according to these matters.

The divine cycles, being two in number, having imitated the form of the whole, were enclosed in a spherical body, which we now call the head. This is the most divine part and rules over all that is within us. To it, the gods entrusted the entire body, having gathered together, realizing that all movements would partake in it. Therefore, so that it would not roll upon the earth, which has various heights and depths, they provided it with a vehicle and ease of movement. Thus, the body acquired length, and the god devised four limbs, enabling it to move through all places.

The gods considered the front to be more honorable and primary, granting us the greater part of our journey. It was necessary for the front of the body to be distinct and unlike the rest of the body. Therefore, first, they placed the face around the head, and they provided it with organs for all the needs of the soul, designating this to be the governing part by nature. Among the organs, they first constructed luminous eyes, having endowed them with such a purpose.

As for fire, while it did not possess the ability to burn, it provided gentle light, suitable for each day, making the body to come into being. For within us, being a brother of this fire, they made it pure, allowing it to flow through the eyes, smooth and dense, especially concentrating in the middle of the eyes, so that the thicker parts would cover all, while this alone would be pure and transparent.

When the daily light surrounds the flow of vision, then it falls from like to like, becoming solid, forming a single body that is unified according to the alignment of the eyes, wherever it may meet what has fallen from the outside. Thus, everything that has come to be through similarity, whatever it may touch, and whatever else it may be, transmits its movements throughout the entire body, providing the soul with the sensation by which we say we see.

When it departs into the night, it is severed from the kindred fire; for when it goes out to the unlike, it becomes altered and extinguished, no longer being of the same nature as the nearby air, since it has no fire. Therefore, it ceases to see, and it becomes a cause of sleep; for the salvation that the gods devised for vision, the nature of the eyelids, when they close, restrains the inner power of the fire, while it disperses and smooths the internal movements. When the movements are smoothed, tranquility arises, and when much tranquility occurs, a brief sleep falls upon it.

When certain greater movements are left, such as those that might remain in certain places, they provide such and so many memories of images that have been absorbed within and outside when awakened. As for the creation of reflections in mirrors and all that is clear and smooth, it is no longer difficult to see. For from the inner and outer fire, each shares with the other, and one becomes smooth while being transformed in many ways; all such things appear necessarily, as the fire around the face becomes smooth and bright, forming a solid body.

The right side perceives the left, as the opposite parts of vision become the opposite in contact with the established nature of the encounter: the right is the right, and the left is the left, conversely, when it transforms into the light that is condensed. When the smoothness of the mirrors, having taken height from both sides, pushes the right towards the left part of vision and the other upon the other.

As for the length of the face, it has made everything appear upside down, the lower part towards the upper part of the light, and the upper part towards the lower part again.

Thus, all these matters are among the causes to which the divine makes use, forming the ideal of the best according to its capacity. It is esteemed by the majority not as a cause but as the origin of all things, cooling and heating, solidifying and dispersing, and performing all such actions. Yet, it is incapable of reason or intellect in any respect. For among all beings, only that which possesses intellect is worthy of being understood; thus, we must speak of the soul—this being invisible, while fire, water, earth, and air are all visible bodies. The intellect, being the lover of knowledge, must pursue the primary causes of the rational nature, while those that are moved by others are secondary, being moved by necessity.

Therefore, we must also consider both types of causes: we must speak of both kinds of causes, distinguishing those that create with reason and goodness from those that, having been isolated, work upon the chaotic and random. Thus, let us speak of the powers of the eyes, which are necessary for the strength they now possess: the greatest of these, for our benefit, must be declared, for the divine has granted us this.

Indeed, sight has become the cause of our greatest benefit, for among the words spoken concerning the whole, none could ever be uttered without the sight of stars, the sun, or the heavens. Now, both day and night, the cycles of months and years, equinoxes, and solstices have been arranged in number, providing us with a notion of time and a quest concerning the nature of the whole. From these, we have derived a kind of philosophy, a greater good that has neither come nor will ever come to the mortal race as a gift from the gods.

I declare this to be the greatest good of the eyes: as for the lesser things, what praise could we offer? For the unphilosophical man, blinded, would lament in vain. Yet, let this be said by us: this is the cause for which we have been granted the gift of sight, that we may behold the celestial orbits of the divine intellect and apply them to the revolutions of our own thoughts, which are akin to those, being disturbed yet untroubled. Having learned and partaken in the nature of true reasoning, we shall strive to emulate the divine, which is ever steadfast, while we ourselves are often led astray.

The same reasoning applies to voice and hearing, for these too have been granted to us by the gods for the same reasons. For reason has been established for these matters, contributing the greatest part to them, as much as music is useful for hearing, being given for the sake of harmony. Harmony, having kinship with the rhythms of the soul within us, is not merely for pleasure, as it seems to be now, but is granted by the Muses as an ally for the arrangement and concord of the soul’s rhythm, which is often disordered. Rhythm, in turn, is given as a support for the multitude of graces that arise within us, being a remedy for the most common deficiencies.

Thus, the matters previously mentioned have been briefly demonstrated concerning those things created through intellect; yet it is also necessary to present those that come into being through necessity. For the genesis of this world is indeed a mixture of necessity and the formation of intellect: with intellect governing necessity, it leads the majority of things that come into being toward the best outcome. Thus, through this, necessity, being overcome by the persuasion of reason, established this whole from the very beginning.

If anyone were to assert what has come to pass in this manner, it must be acknowledged that the nature of the wandering cause must also be included, as it is inclined to bear. Therefore, we must again retreat and, having taken these matters into account, seek another principle anew, just as we have done concerning those matters of the past.

We must contemplate the nature of fire, water, air, and earth prior to the creation of the heavens, along with the conditions that preceded them. For no one has yet revealed their genesis, but we speak of fire as if it is known, establishing each of them as the elements of the whole, which are fittingly represented, even if only in a semblance, by one who thinks briefly.

Now, let it be thus with us: concerning all things, whether it be a principle or principles, or however it seems regarding these matters, it need not be declared now, for there is no other reason, and it is difficult to elucidate the apparent truths in the present manner of discourse. Therefore, do not think that I ought to speak, nor that I could persuade myself that I am capable of undertaking such a task correctly. Yet, safeguarding what has been said from the beginning, I shall strive to maintain the power of the apparent truths, attempting to speak no less than is fitting, but rather more, and to speak from the beginning concerning each and all.

Thus, let us now call upon the divine, as we begin again to speak, invoking the savior of our discourse, to preserve us from the strange and unfamiliar narrative, in order to uphold the doctrine of the apparent truths.


Let the beginning concerning the whole be greater than that which was previously divided: for then we distinguished two kinds, but now we must declare a third, different nature. The two were sufficient for the matters previously discussed; one was a type of exemplary form, intelligible and always existing in the same way, while the second was a mere imitation of the first, possessing generation and being visible. The third, however, we did not previously distinguish, believing the two to be sufficient; now, however, the discourse seems to compel us to attempt to manifest a difficult and obscure kind.

What then shall we suppose regarding its power and nature? It must be such as to serve as a receptacle for all generation, akin to a nurturing mother. It has been said truly, yet we must speak more clearly about it, for it is difficult to preemptively inquire about fire and the necessities that follow it. For to speak of each, what it truly is—whether water should be said to be more so than fire, or any of the others in their own right—thus, it is challenging to use a trustworthy and certain discourse.

How then shall we speak of this, and in what manner? First, that which we now call water, we see it solidifying into stones and earth; and as it melts and separates, this same essence becomes spirit and air. When the air is ignited, it becomes fire, and when it is again gathered and extinguished, it returns to the form of air. Again, as air condenses, it forms clouds and mist, and from these, as they further coalesce, flowing water emerges; from water, earth and stones arise once more, thus perpetuating a cycle of generation.

Thus, when contemplating these things, how can one firmly assert what each of them is, as being this and not something else? It is not difficult; rather, it is most secure to speak of them in this way: always that which we observe as being generated at one time or another, as fire, should not be called this but rather that which is similar at each instance. Neither should we call this water, but rather that which is similar, nor should we ever assert anything as having certainty, as we demonstrate through this discourse.

Yet, let us not speak of each of these individually, but rather call that which is always in motion by the name of each, and indeed fire should always be called such, and all that possesses generation: in which each of them is always perceived as existing and again perishes from there. Only that should be named which is this and that, while anything else, whether hot or cold or any opposites, and all that arises from these, should not be called that.

Moreover, we must strive to speak even more clearly about it. For if someone were to fashion shapes from gold, and not alter them, but rather cease to transform each into all, when one of them is shown and asked what it is, it would be most secure to say that it is gold, while the triangular shape and all other forms that arise from it should never be said to exist as they are, for they change when placed between. But if one wishes to accept such a thing with certainty, let them embrace it.

The same reasoning applies to the nature that receives all bodies. It must always be referred to as the same: for from itself, it does not cease to exist in power—indeed, it always receives all, and no form ever takes on a likeness to any of those entering it. For it lies as a mold of nature, being moved and reshaped by those entering, and it appears at different times as different things—yet those entering and exiting are always imitations, stamped in a certain wondrous manner, which we again consider.

In the present discourse, we must think of three kinds: the one that is generated, the one in which it is generated, and the one from which the generated takes its form. And indeed, it is fitting to liken the receptive nature to a mother, the source to a father, and the nature between them to a progeny. One must conceive that it will not otherwise be than as a mold, destined to receive all varieties of forms, which, when well prepared, may exist in a formless state, awaiting the impressions of all those ideas it is to receive. For, being similar to those that enter, if it receives something of an opposite nature, it would poorly assimilate, reflecting its own appearance.

Thus, it is necessary for the receptacle of all things to be distinct from the forms, just as the ointments, which are first created from fragrant substances, exist in their essence, producing the most fragrant of the moist things. Those who attempt to remove shapes from certain soft substances allow no clear form to exist, but rather work to create the smoothest.

In the same manner, the nature that receives all things must always be capable of receiving the many forms of all that exists outside of itself. Therefore, let us not speak of the mother and receptacle of the visible and all that is sensible as being earth, air, fire, or water, nor of those that arise from these, but rather of an invisible and formless essence, all-receptive, partaking in the most obscure of the intelligible and the most elusive, we shall not speak falsely.

As far as it is possible to reach the nature of this essence, one might rightly say: fire is always manifest in its heated part, while the moist is water, and earth and air are as far as they receive imitations of these. Yet, we must more thoroughly distinguish in discourse: is there a fire in itself, and are all those things we always speak of thus existing in themselves, or are they merely what we see, and all else we sense through the body, possessing such truth alone, while others do not exist apart from these in any way? Is it not in vain that we assert there is an intelligible form of each, when nothing exists but the word?

Thus, it is not fitting to leave the present unexamined and unjudged, nor to assert that it has such a nature without further inquiry. If a great definition were to be established briefly, it would be most fitting. Therefore, I now cast my vote. If indeed intellect and true opinion are two kinds, they must entirely exist in themselves, being forms that are imperceptible to us, understood only in thought. But if, as some seem to suggest, true opinion differs from intellect in that it signifies nothing, then all that we sense through the body must be held as most certain.

Thus, we must speak of these two, for they have come into being separately and hold different natures. For indeed, one arises through teaching, while the other is born of persuasion: the former is always accompanied by true discourse, while the latter is devoid of reason. The former is unchanging through persuasion, while the latter is subject to change. Of the former, it is said that all men partake, while the divine intellect belongs to the gods, and the race of men is but a fleeting thing. Given these distinctions, it must be acknowledged that there is one kind that possesses the same essence, ungenerated and indestructible, neither receiving anything from elsewhere nor transforming into something else. This essence is invisible and otherwise imperceptible, which indeed thought has grasped to contemplate.

The second kind, which is homonymous and similar to the first, is perceptible, generated, always in motion, coming into being in a certain place and again perishing from there, comprehensible through opinion and sensation. The third kind, again, is that of the eternal realm, not subject to decay, providing a foundation for all that possesses generation, yet it is grasped through a certain spurious reasoning, scarcely trustworthy. To this, we dreamily assert that it is necessary for all that exists to be in a certain place and to occupy some space, while nothing exists either on the earth or in the heavens.

Thus, all these things, along with others, are akin to the nature that is truly existing and is present in this dreamlike state. We are unable to arise and delineate the truth, as if it were an image, since this very essence does not belong to itself, but is always carried by some other phantom. Therefore, it is fitting for something to exist in another realm, holding onto a substance in some way, or to be nothing at all. To that which truly exists, the precise and truthful discourse serves as an aid, for as long as one thing may be, the other cannot ever become one in another, nor can two things ever become one and the same.

Thus, let there be a discourse, calculated according to my vote, concerning the essence, the realm, and the origin of things, divided into three parts, even before the heavens came into being. The mother of generation, being moist and fiery, receives the forms of earth and air, along with all other qualities that accompany these states. It appears to be of various kinds, yet due to the absence of equal forces or balances, it cannot be harmoniously balanced in any respect. Rather, it is tossed about unevenly, shaken by those elements, and in turn, it causes those elements to shake as well. The moving things are ever carried apart, just as those substances are shaken and separated by the instruments and devices used in the purification of grain, where the dense and heavy are carried to one place, while the light and airy are borne to another.

Thus, the four kinds are shaken by the vessel, as if the vessel itself were an instrument providing a tremor. The most dissimilar of these tend to define themselves apart, while the most similar gather together into one. Therefore, these things possess different realms, even before the whole was adorned from them. Indeed, prior to this, all these existed without reason and without measure. But when there was an attempt to bring order to the whole, first there was fire, then water, earth, and air, each retaining traces of their own essence, altogether arranged as is fitting when a god departs from any place. Thus, these things first took shape in forms and numbers.

And as it is possible, let us strive to establish them as beautifully and excellently as the divine would have them, so that this may always be said to exist among us. Now, therefore, let us endeavor to elucidate the arrangement of each and their origins in an unfamiliar discourse before you, for since you partake in the paths of education through which the aforementioned must be demonstrated, you shall comprehend.

First, indeed, it is evident that fire, earth, water, and air are bodies, and this is clear to all. The essence of each body possesses both form and depth. Furthermore, this depth must necessarily encompass the nature of the plane: the upright base of the plane is composed of triangles. All triangles arise from two forms: one having a right angle at each corner, while the others possess acute angles. Of these, one has a portion of the right angle divided into equal sides, while the other is divided into unequal parts.

Thus, we posit the origin of fire and the other bodies according to the reasoning that follows necessity: yet the true origins of these things are known only to the divine and to those men who are favored by Him. It is necessary to speak of what the four bodies might be, differing from one another, yet capable of being dissolved into one another: for in this way, we possess the truth concerning the generation of earth and fire, as well as the reasoning in between.

For we shall not concede that there are bodies more beautiful than these, each belonging to its own kind. Therefore, let us strive to unite the four kinds of bodies, differing in beauty, and declare that we have sufficiently grasped their nature. Among the two triangles, one possesses an isosceles nature, while the other is infinitely extended. Thus, we must choose the most beautiful of the infinite, if we are to begin in this manner.

If anyone should possess a more beautiful selection to speak of in the composition of these, that person is not an enemy but a friend who prevails. Therefore, we shall set forth the most beautiful of the many triangles, surpassing the others, from which the equilateral triangle is formed from the third.

For this reason, the discourse is more abundant: yet to the one who examines this and finds it thus, the rewards lie in friendship. Let us then choose two triangles from which both the fire and the other bodies are constructed: one being isosceles, and the other possessing a triple nature, always having the greater side of the lesser. What has been previously stated ambiguously must now be more clearly defined.

For the four kinds appeared to possess a generation through one another, not rightly conceived: for indeed, from the triangles we have chosen, four kinds arise, three from one that has unequal sides, and the fourth solely from the isosceles triangle. Therefore, it is not possible for all to be dissolved into one another, from many small things becoming few great ones, and vice versa; yet the three can be so: for from one, all things that have come into being, when the greater are dissolved, many small ones will be formed from the same, receiving the appropriate shapes, and when the small are scattered according to the triangles, they would become one number, forming a great mass of another kind.

Thus, let this be said concerning the generation into one another: how each of them has come into being and from how many numbers they have been formed, would be the next matter to discuss.

Thus, let us begin with the first and smallest form, which is constituted as an element, having a length that is double that of the lesser side of the triangle it subtends. When two such triangles are combined along the diameter, and this is done three times, aligning the diameters and the shorter sides to a common center, there arises one equilateral triangle composed of six units.

Equilateral triangles, when combined, create four triangular planes that form a single solid angle, resulting in the obtuse angle of the planes that follows. From such combinations of four, the first solid form is established, evenly distributed into equal and similar parts.

The second form arises from the same triangles, wherein eight equilateral triangles are combined to create a solid angle from four planes. Thus, with six of these, the second body has reached its conclusion.

The third form is composed of sixty of the elements, yielding twelve solid angles, enclosed by five planes of equilateral triangles, resulting in a body with twenty bases of equilateral triangles. One of these forms has been derived from the elements, while the isosceles triangle gives rise to the nature of the fourth, being constituted from four, converging the right angles to the center, thus forming one equilateral square.

From six such combinations, eight solid angles were produced, arranged according to three planes, each being right-angled. The shape of the resulting body became cubic, possessing six bases of equilateral squares.

Moreover, with the existence of a fifth composition, the divine employed it to encompass the whole in a manner of illustration. Now, if one were to consider all things with reason, he might ponder whether it is necessary to speak of worlds as infinite or as having limits. For if one were to assert that they are indeed infinite, it would be a doctrine of the truly boundless, which must be experienced. Conversely, one might question whether it is appropriate to declare that there exists one or five worlds, and in this regard, one might find himself in reasonable perplexity.

Thus, we assert that there is one world, as the reasoning suggests, which reveals the divine; yet another, gazing elsewhere, may hold different beliefs. Let us then set aside this matter and now distribute the existing forms according to the elements of fire, earth, water, and air.

To the earth, we grant the cubic form: for among the four kinds, earth is the most immobile and the most malleable of bodies, and it is indeed necessary for it to possess the most secure bases. The base formed from the foundational triangles is more secure by nature than that of the unequal sides, and the plane formed from each side of the equilateral triangle is inherently more stable, both in parts and as a whole.

Therefore, in assigning this to the earth according to reason, we preserve its essence. Water, on the other hand, is the most difficult to move, while fire is the most mobile, and air occupies the middle ground. The smallest body is fire, the largest is water, and air is in between. Fire is the sharpest, followed by air, and then water.

Thus, all these elements must be conceived as small, so that each of the kinds appears to us as nothing due to their minuteness. Yet when many of their volumes are gathered, they become visible. Moreover, concerning the ratios of quantities, movements, and other forces, we must consider the divine, wherever the nature of necessity, having been persuaded, yields. In all these matters, through precision, they are arranged according to reason by Him.

From all that we have previously mentioned regarding the kinds, thus it may be most reasonable to consider their nature. Earth, when it encounters fire, may be dissolved by its sharpness, whether it be within the fire itself or within the mass of air or water, until the parts of the earth, having met in some manner, are reassembled into themselves, becoming earth once more— for it could never transform into another kind. Water, on the other hand, when divided by fire or even by air, may become a single body of fire and two bodies of air; the parts of air, when one portion is dissolved, may yield two bodies of fire.

Moreover, when fire is contained within air, water, or some earth, and is moved among many small things, battling and being vanquished, it may be shattered, resulting in two bodies of fire combining into one form of air. And when the air is held fast, being fragmented from two wholes and half of water, it will become one solid mass.

Thus, let us reason again about these matters: when something is taken in fire, if it is cut by the sharpness of its angles and sides, it will cease to be cut, having settled into the nature of that which it is— for each kind, being similar and identical to itself, cannot undergo any change nor suffer from that which is similarly constituted— until it becomes something lesser, fighting against something greater, it does not cease to dissolve.

Moreover, when the smaller parts are encompassed within the larger, they may be extinguished, and thus they will willingly coalesce into the form of that which prevails, becoming fire from air, and water from air. But if they should go into the same and encounter other kinds, they do not cease to dissolve until they are entirely thrust out and dissolved into their kindred, or until they are vanquished, becoming one from many, remaining united with that which has prevailed.

Thus, through these experiences, all realms are transformed: for the quantities of each kind are dispersed according to their own places due to the motion of the receiving element, while the dissimilar are each carried to their own, and the similar are transported through the tremors to the places to which they are likened.

Therefore, all the primal and unmingled bodies have come to be through such causes. Yet in their forms, other kinds have been infused, necessitating the composition of each of the elements, not merely planting one triangle at the origins, but also lesser and greater ones, having a number as great as the kinds that may exist in their forms.

Thus, when they are mixed together, both among themselves and with one another, the variety is infinite; and it is this that those who are to contemplate nature must observe, using reason fittingly.

Concerning motion and rest, one might ponder how and with what elements they come to be; unless one were to reach a consensus, there would be many obstacles to the reasoning that follows. Much has already been said about these matters, and in addition to those, we assert that in a state of smoothness, there should never be a desire for motion. For it is difficult, indeed more so impossible, for that which is to be moved to exist without that which moves it, or for the mover to act without that which is moved. Motion cannot exist in the absence of these; thus, it is impossible for these to be smooth.

Therefore, let us always place rest in smoothness and motion in roughness, with the cause of this roughness being inequality. We have already discussed the generation of inequality; however, we have not yet spoken of how, when each kind is separated, it ceases to engage in motion and transfer with one another.

Thus, we shall speak again. The cycle of the whole, having encompassed the kinds, being circular and naturally inclined to unite with itself, constrains all and allows no empty space to remain. Therefore, fire has been most thoroughly dispersed into all, while air follows as the second, being second in fineness, and the others follow suit: for those that have arisen from the largest parts leave the greatest void in their composition, while the smallest leave the least.

The gathering of the smallest draws them into the voids of the larger. Thus, when the small are placed among the large, distinguishing the greater from the lesser, and comparing the larger with those, all things are transferred up and down to their respective places: for the change in size alters the position of each.

Thus, through these matters, the generation preserved by roughness always provides for the continual motion of these elements, which will be ever-present and unceasing.

Verily, after these matters, one must contemplate that many forms of fire have come into being, such as the flame that departs from the fire itself, which burns not, yet bestows light upon the eyes. Likewise, from the extinguished flame, there remains a remnant in the fiery realms. In the same manner, the air is divided; the purest is called ether, while the thickest is mist and darkness, along with other unnamed forms, arising from the inequality of the triangles.

As for water, it is first divided into two kinds: the liquid and the solid. The liquid, being composed of small and unequal parts, is in constant motion, both in itself and by the influence of others, due to its irregularity and the nature of its shape. The solid, on the other hand, is more stable, being composed of larger and smoother particles, heavy and firm in its evenness. Yet, when fire enters and dissolves this evenness, it loses its stability and becomes more mobile, being pushed by the nearby air and stretching towards the earth, thus melting away the solidity of its forms, and the flow upon the earth receives the name of each of these conditions.

Again, when fire departs from its source, not entering into the void, the nearby air, being still in motion, pushes the liquid mass towards the seats of the fire, mingling it with itself. The mingled substance, regaining its evenness, returns to its original state, as the creator of irregularity, the fire, departs. The cooling of the fire is thus called a solid, and the gathering of the departed fire is a form of solidity.

Of all these, we speak of the waters that are liquid; the most refined and smoothest become a dense and uniform substance, shining with a golden hue, a most precious treasure akin to gold, which is drawn through stone. The essence of gold, being dense and dark, is called diamond. Near to gold, there are many forms, some denser than gold itself, and possessing a small and fine portion of earth, thus becoming harder, while others have large voids within, making them lighter. Among the brilliant substances, a kind of water has been established as copper.

When mixed with earth, it is said that when they are separated again, they become manifest as a distinct substance, known as poison. The rest of such matters do not require further deliberation, as they pursue the idea of the images of myths. When one takes a moment of respite to ponder the nature of existence, reflecting upon the genesis of things, they may attain a lasting pleasure, cultivating a moderate and wise disposition in life.

Thus, we shall now proceed to discuss the subsequent matters concerning these same elements. Water mingled with fire, as it is a fine liquid due to its motion and the path it takes as it rolls upon the earth, is called liquid. It is soft, yielding less firmly than the bases that are more stable upon the earth. When this substance, having separated from fire and isolated from air, becomes more even, it is then subjected to the outgoing forces, resulting in hail above the earth, while upon the earth, it becomes crystal. Lesser forms, still semi-solid, manifest as snow above the earth, while upon the ground, the dew solidifies into frost.

Most of the various forms of water are mingled with one another—altogether forming a kind, through the plants of the earth, known as juices. Through their mixtures, each retains a certain irregularity, providing many other unnamed forms, while four fiery kinds have received names: the first, the warming wine of the soul with the body; the second, the smooth and distinguishing oil, which appears bright and shining, resembling the lustrous form of oil; the third, the sweet honey, which is most esteemed among all; and the fourth, the frothy essence, which, being separated from all the juices, is called sap.

As for the forms of the earth, that which is refined through water becomes a stony body in this manner. When the mingled water is cut in its mixture, it transforms into the essence of air, rising to its rightful place. Yet, nothing surpasses this void; thus, the nearby air is expelled. Being heavy, it is thrust and enveloped by the mass of the earth, greatly compressing and forcing it into the seats from whence the young air ascends. Thus, the earth, pressed by the air, is composed into stone, with the transparent parts being fairer, while the contrary is deemed less beautiful.

Moreover, when the moisture is swiftly seized by fire, it becomes a more clamorous substance, which we have named clay. There are times when, after the moisture has been left behind, the earth, through the action of fire when cooled, takes on a dark hue, becoming stone. Again, from the same mixture of water, when separated, the finer parts of the earth, being salty and semi-solid, are released once more by water. The cleansing essence of oil and earth has become a precious substance, pleasing to the senses, a body beloved by the divine law.

The common elements, when mingled with water, do not dissolve, nor do they yield to fire, for they are thus bound together. The masses of the earth are not melted by fire or air; for the structure of their voids, being smaller, allows for great spaciousness, and thus they remain unyielding and intact. However, the waters, having larger parts, force their way out, dissolving the earth. For the earth, being unyielding, is thus only dissolved by water, while nothing else, save fire, can penetrate it.

The union of water is most violently affected only by fire, while the weaker union is influenced by both fire and air, the former flowing through the voids, and the latter through the triangles. Yet, the air, when forced together, dissolves nothing but according to its element, while the fire alone melts without force.

Thus, the bodies composed of the mingling of earth and water, as long as the water holds the voids of the earth tightly, allow the outer waters to flow around the whole mass, leaving it intact. The fire, entering into the voids of the waters, transforms the water into air, thus causing the common body to flow. These substances, being less than the water or earth, are all that is called the waxy and fragrant bodies, while those with more water are all that coalesce into wax-like and aromatic forms.

And thus, the forms, adorned with their associations and transformations, are nearly displayed in a multitude of ways; yet, the affections arising from them must be revealed through their causes. First and foremost, it is necessary to acknowledge the existence of sensation in all that is spoken of, pertaining to the flesh and the generation of flesh, as well as the soul, as long as it remains mortal; for we have not yet departed from this understanding. Indeed, neither can these exist apart from the affections, nor can those be sufficiently articulated without these; thus, it is nearly impossible to speak of them in isolation.

Let us then propose first the matters at hand, and we shall return to those previously suggested. In order that we may speak of the affections in relation to their origins, let us first consider the body and the soul. Initially, we speak of fire as warm; let us observe, contemplating the distinction and division of it concerning our body. For we all perceive that the passion is something sharp; the fineness of the sides and angles, the sharpness of the small parts, and the swiftness of the motion—these all cut sharply into whatever they encounter.

We must remember the nature of its form, for it is that very essence which distinguishes us, breaking down our bodies into smaller parts, which we now rightly call warm, and thus it has bestowed upon us this name. The contrary of these is evident, yet let it not be a matter of discourse. For the moist elements, entering in larger forms, push out the smaller ones, unable to settle into their respective seats, thus forcing our moist nature, moving from the irregular to the unmoving through smoothness, and in this union, they solidify.

What is gathered against nature fights against itself, pushing away in opposition. In this struggle and tumult, trembling and shivering arise, and all this passion is deemed cold, as is the action itself. That which is hard, to which our flesh yields, is called soft, while that which is soft yields to the flesh; thus, they stand in relation to one another. It yields as it approaches the small; yet that which is based on squares, being greatly trodden upon, is the most contrary form, as it approaches density with the greatest opposition.

Heavy and light, when examined in relation to the nature of what is below and above, can be clearly defined. For nature indeed has divided certain places into two opposing realms: the lower, to which all that possesses some mass is drawn, and the upper, to which all comes involuntarily, not to be considered upright anywhere. For the entirety of the universe, being spherical, all that is distanced from the center has become the furthest, and thus it must be that the extremes are likewise formed, while the center must be measured by the same metrics as the extremes.

In this world, as it is thus formed, what of the aforementioned can be placed above or below without just cause to declare that nothing is fitting to name? For the middle place within it is neither below nor above, but exists in the center; while the surrounding area is neither middle nor possessing a different part from another, but rather more towards the center or something directly opposite.

Thus, what is equally formed everywhere, what names might one bring forth that are contrary, and how might one rightly consider them? For if something were indeed solid at the center of the whole, it would never be drawn into any of the extremes due to their universal similarity. Yet, if one were to travel around it in a circle, they would often find themselves standing opposite, both below and above, speaking of the same.

For the whole, as has been said, being spherical, has a certain place below, while the above cannot be rightly spoken of. Hence, these have been named and in what we are accustomed to through these, and the entire heavens are thus divided, we must acknowledge these as we propose these matters to ourselves.

If one were to stand in the realm where the nature of fire is most profoundly embraced, where it gathers in abundance, and, having the power to intervene, were to take parts of the fire and place them upon a scale, lifting the balance and drawing the fire into an unequal air, it would become evident that the lesser is more easily compelled. For with a single force, the lesser, when suspended, is more readily drawn, while the greater, being heavier, must inevitably yield to the violence of the situation, and thus the heavier is called downwards, while the lighter ascends.

In like manner, we must consider ourselves acting within this very realm. For standing upon the earth, we, of the earthy kind, sometimes draw the earth itself into an unequal air, by force and against nature, both elements clinging to their kin. The smaller, therefore, more readily follows the greater, compelled into the unequal. Thus, we have called it light, and the place to which we are drawn is above, while the contrary passion is heavy and below.

It is thus necessary that these elements differ from one another, for the multitude of kinds occupies opposing places—what is light in one realm is heavy in another, and what is heavy in one place is light in the opposite. All things, therefore, will be found to be contrary and diverse in relation to one another. This must be contemplated as a singular thought regarding all these matters, for the path towards the kindred is heavy for each, making the burden descend, while the place to which such a burden is drawn is below, and those possessing the opposite nature are otherwise.

Concerning these affections, let these causes be stated. For the cause of the smooth and the rough affections can be discerned by all who observe, and one might speak of them differently: for hardness, mingled with irregularity, provides the roughness, while smoothness is offered through density.
