Socrates

One, two, three: but pray tell me, dear Timaeus, where is the fourth among those who dined with us yesterday, and now among the hosts?

Timaeus

A certain ailment has befallen him, O Socrates; for he would not willingly have absented himself from our gathering.

Socrates

Shall it then be your duty to fill the void left by his absence, both in deed and in the discourse concerning him?

Timaeus

Indeed, it shall be so, and according to our ability, we shall leave nothing wanting; for it would not be just that those who were entertained by you yesterday should not eagerly share with the rest of us.

Socrates

Do you then remember all that you were to recount regarding the matters I set forth?

Timaeus

We remember those things, but for what we do not, you may remind us; and moreover, if it be not too burdensome for you, return to the beginning briefly, that it may be more firmly established among us.

Socrates

So be it. Yesterday, it was the essence of the discourse I delivered concerning the state that appeared to me most fitting, and from what sort of men it might best arise.

Timaeus

And indeed, it was spoken well among us, O Socrates, in accordance with reason.

Socrates

Shall we not then distinguish the various arts of the husbandmen from those of the warriors, as we first did in our discourse?

Timaeus

Yes.

Socrates

And according to nature, granting to each his own suitable pursuit, one art for each, we shall declare that those who ought to be warriors must be the guardians of the city, whether some from without or even from within should arise to do harm, judging gently those who are friends by nature and are in authority, yet fierce in battle against those who confront them from among the enemies.

Timaeus

Indeed, it shall be so.

Socrates

For I believe we have spoken of a certain nature of the guardians of the soul, that they must be both spirited and philosophical, so that they may rightly be gentle towards one another and fierce when the occasion demands.

Timaeus

Yes.

Socrates

And what of their nourishment? Should they not be nurtured in gymnastics and music, and all that pertains to them, in every respect?

Timaeus

Indeed, it shall be so.

Socrates

And those thus nurtured ought to be taught that they should not consider any possession of gold or silver or any other private wealth as their own, but rather, as hired guardians receiving a wage for their service from those whom they protect, a wage that is moderate and temperate, to be spent in common and to live together with one another, ever mindful of virtue, while allowing leisure for the other pursuits.

Timaeus

These matters have also been spoken of in this way.

Socrates

And indeed, we have also recalled concerning women, that their natures should be harmonized with those of men, and that all pursuits should be shared in common, both in war and in other aspects of life.

Timaeus

Thus it was also said.

Socrates

What then of the matter of procreation? Is it not memorable, due to the novelty of what has been said, that we have established that the matters of marriage and of children should be common to all, devising a means that none should ever know their own offspring, and that all should regard one another as of the same kin, brothers and sisters, as many as may be born within the proper age, and those who are parents and ancestors above, and those below, the children of children?

Timaeus

Yes, and these matters are indeed memorable as you say.

Socrates

And that they should be born as the best of natures, do we not remember that we said the rulers should secretly devise a lottery for the unions of marriage, so that the base may be separated from the good, and that no enmity should arise among them due to this, considering chance as the cause of their unions?

Timaeus

We do remember.

Socrates

And indeed, we have said that the good should be nurtured, while the bad should be sent to another city in secret; and as they increase, we must always seek to elevate the worthy again, while those unworthy among them should be transferred to the land of the returning.

Timaeus

So it is.

Socrates

Have we then already concluded, as we did yesterday, to return once more to the principal points, or do we still desire to discuss something further that remains unaddressed, dear Timaeus, as if it were left behind?

Timaeus

By no means, for those very matters were indeed the ones spoken of, O Socrates.

Socrates

I would fain hear what follows concerning the city we have traversed, for I find myself in a certain state akin to this: as if one, having beheld some beautiful creature, whether wrought by art or living in truth, and leading a tranquil existence, were to be seized by a desire to see it in motion, and to witness what might be fitting for it in the course of its endeavors. In like manner, I feel towards the city we have discussed. For I would gladly listen to the tales of the contests in which the city engages, striving against other cities, both in war and in the arts of warfare, rendering fitting honors to education and nourishment, according to the deeds performed and the discourses delivered to each of the cities. Thus, O Critias and Hermocrates, I have come to the conclusion that I am not capable of sufficiently praising the men and the city. And this is no wonder; but I have also received the same opinion regarding the events of old and the poets of the present, not in any way disparaging the poetic craft, but it is evident to all that the mimetic art, wherever it is nurtured, will easily and excellently imitate these things. Yet that which arises outside of its nurture is difficult to achieve in deeds, and even more so in words. As for the sophists, I consider them well-versed in many words and other fine matters, yet I fear that, being wanderers among the cities and having no proper governance, they may be unworthy companions of philosophers and statesmen, as they engage in deeds and words concerning warfare and battles. Thus, the nature of your disposition remains, partaking of both in essence and nurture. For Timaeus here, being of the most well-governed city of Locri in Italy, is not inferior in substance or lineage to any there, having been entrusted with the greatest offices and honors of the city, while in my view, he has attained the pinnacle of philosophy. As for Critias, we all know him to be no private man among those we speak of. And concerning Hermocrates, regarding nature and nurture, it is fitting to trust in the many witnesses to these matters. Therefore, yesterday, pondering your desire to discuss the city, I willingly offered my assistance, knowing that none among you would be more capable of delivering the subsequent discourse—if indeed the city were to be established in a manner fitting for war, it would alone render to itself all that is appropriate, as I now declare. Thus, having conferred together, I stand ready, adorned for this task and fully prepared to receive your words.

Hermocrates

Indeed, as Timaeus has said, O Socrates, we shall not lack in eagerness nor is there any excuse for us not to act upon these matters. For even yesterday, as soon as we arrived here at Critias’ lodging, where we are also to stay, we were already contemplating these things along the way. Thus, he has introduced to us a discourse from ancient hearsay: which you too, Critias, should now relate, that he may lend his approval to the task, whether he be fit or unfit for it.

Critias

These things must be done, if Timaeus, our third companion, agrees.

Timaeus

It seems so.

Critias

Listen then, O Socrates, to a tale that is indeed strange, yet wholly true, as Solon, the wisest of the seven, once declared. There was indeed a man, a very dear friend of ours, the grandfather of Dropides, as he himself often speaks in his poetry. To Critias, our grandfather, he said, as the elder recalled to us, that there were great and wondrous works of this city, long since vanished through time and the decay of men, yet one among them was the greatest, which now, in remembrance, it would be fitting for us to honor you and the deity at the festival, just as we might praise those who sing hymns in truth and justice.

Socrates

You speak well. But what is this work, Critias, that you do not mention, as if it were an ancient deed performed by this city, according to the account of Solon?

Critias

I shall recount, having heard an ancient tale from no recent man. For at that time, Critias, as he said, was nearly ninety years of age, while I was but a mere lad. The festival of the Cureotes was upon us, coinciding with the Apaturia. It was customary for the children to engage in contests during this festival: for our fathers had set forth competitions in recitation. Many poems were recited by various poets, and among them, we knew well the works of Solon, which were new at that time. One of my kinsmen, whether he thought so at the time or perhaps out of some favor towards Critias, declared that Solon had become the wisest of all men and, in his poetry, the most free-spirited of all poets. The elder—indeed, I remember it well—was greatly pleased and, smiling, said: ‘If, O Amynander, he did not employ his poetry in a trivial manner, but rather labored as others do, then the discourse he brought from Egypt was complete, and he was not compelled, due to the strife and other evils he encountered here, to compose it in a manner that was less than fitting. In my view, neither Hesiod nor Homer nor any other poet ever attained greater renown than he.’ ‘What was the discourse?’ said he. ‘It was concerning the greatest and most renowned of all just actions that this city performed, which, due to the passage of time and the decay of those who wrought it, has not endured here in its entirety.’ ‘Speak from the beginning,’ said he, ‘what it was, how it was, and from whom it was said to be true, as Solon declared.’

In the land of Egypt, there exists a region within the Delta, where the waters of the Nile divide, known as the Saïtic nome. In this nome lies the grand city of Sais, from whence the king Amasis hailed. The chief deity of this city is Neith, known to the Greeks as Athena; indeed, the inhabitants of Sais claim a certain kinship with the Athenians. Solon, upon visiting them, was held in high esteem, and he sought to inquire of the ancient priests, who were well-versed in such matters, about the olden times. Yet, he found no Greek, not even himself, who could speak of these things with any authority.

In his quest for knowledge, he endeavored to draw forth tales of the ancients, seeking to discuss the earliest legends, including those of Phoroneus and Niobe, and after the great flood, the stories of Deucalion and Pyrrha, as well as their descendants, and the years that had passed since those times. One of the priests, speaking with great wisdom, remarked, "O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are always but children; there is no elder Greek among you." Upon hearing this, Solon inquired, "What do you mean by this?" The priest replied, "You are all young in spirit; for you possess no ancient knowledge or wisdom passed down through the ages. The reason for this is that many great destructions have befallen mankind, and more shall come, some by fire and others by water, and many other shorter calamities."

The tale told among you speaks of how once Phaethon, son of Helios, attempted to drive his father's chariot but, unable to control it, set the earth ablaze and was himself struck down by lightning. This story, while a myth, holds a kernel of truth regarding the changes that have occurred on earth over long ages, leading to great destruction by fire. Those who dwell in the mountains and high places, as well as in arid regions, are more likely to survive than those near rivers and seas. For us, the Nile serves as a savior, rescuing us from such calamities.

When the gods cleanse the earth with waters, some, like the shepherds in the mountains, are saved, while others in your cities are swept away into the sea by the rivers. In this land, neither then nor at any other time does water flow down upon the fields; rather, it is the opposite, as all water flows up from below. Thus, for these reasons, the ancient tales are preserved here, and the truth is that in all places where there is no severe winter or scorching heat, the population of mankind is always greater or lesser.

As for those tales, whether from your land or elsewhere, of great deeds or notable differences, all are inscribed in the ancient temples and preserved. What you and others have recently constructed is recorded in writing, and all cities require such records. Yet, through the passage of time, like a disease, a heavenly current has come upon you, leaving the unlettered and uneducated among you, so that you are as if reborn, knowing nothing of the ancient times, neither of your own history nor that of others.

Indeed, what has been genealogically established, O Solon, regarding your people, differs little from myths, for you remember but one great flood that occurred long before many other events. Furthermore, you do not know of the most beautiful and noble lineage that once existed in your land, from which you and your city now descend, having been left with but a remnant of that ancient seed, while you have forgotten due to the many generations that have passed without written records.

For there was a time, O Solon, when the city of the Athenians, now existing, was the greatest in valor and the most just in all matters, renowned for its splendid deeds and governance, said to be the finest of all under the heavens.

Upon hearing this, Solon expressed his astonishment and earnestly requested the priests to elaborate on the matters concerning the ancient citizens with great precision. The priest replied, "There is no envy, O Solon, but rather I speak for your sake and for the sake of your city, especially in gratitude to the goddess, who has favored and nurtured both your people and ours, having received the seed from the Earth and Hephaestus long before you, and this city in later times. In our sacred writings, the number of years recorded here amounts to eight thousand.

Now, concerning the events of the nine thousand years, I shall briefly outline the laws and the most splendid deeds accomplished by them; the precise details we shall explore further in due time, taking the writings in hand.

Consider the laws here: you will discover many examples of what existed among you then. First, the lineage of the priests is distinctly set apart from the others, followed by that of the artisans, each working independently without mingling with one another, as well as the herdsmen and the farmers. Moreover, I have perceived that the warrior class is also separated from all other lineages, with no other duties assigned to them by law except those pertaining to war.

Furthermore, their relationship to arms, such as shields and spears, is notable, for we were the first to be armed among those concerning Asia, as the goddess had indicated in those places among you. As for wisdom, you can see how much care the law has taken from the very beginning regarding the cosmos, encompassing everything from divination to medicine for the health of mankind, acquiring all other subjects that follow.

Thus, the goddess, having adorned and organized all these things, settled you in a chosen place where you were born, observing the temperate seasons therein, knowing that you would be the wisest of men. Therefore, being both warlike and philosophical, the goddess selected the most suitable men to inhabit this place and established them first.

You dwell under such laws and are even more favorably governed than all other peoples, surpassing them in virtue, as is fitting for beings born of and educated by the gods. Many of your great works are inscribed here in the city, yet one stands out above all in size and virtue: for it is written that your city once halted a power that was advancing in hubris against all of Europe and Asia, having surged forth from the Atlantic Sea.

At that time, the sea was navigable; for there was an island at the mouth of the strait, which you call the Pillars of Hercules, and that island was larger than Libya and Asia combined, from which travelers could embark to the other islands and from those islands to the entire continent surrounding that true sea.

Thus, all that we speak of within the strait appears to have a narrow harbor for entry; yet that sea, truly, would be rightly called a continent. In that island of Atlantis, there arose a great and wondrous power of kings, ruling over the entire island and many other islands and parts of the continent, extending their dominion as far as Libya, up to Egypt, and as far as Europe, to Tyrrhenia.

This entire power, having gathered into one, once attempted to enslave all the lands both yours and ours and all that lay within the strait. At that time, O Solon, the might of your city became manifest to all men in virtue and strength: for it stood firm against all dangers, leading the Greeks in valor and arts of war.

In the days of yore, when the Greeks stood as leaders, and the rest, having been compelled to withdraw, found themselves in dire straits, they faced the gravest of dangers. Yet, through valor and fortitude, they erected a trophy of victory against their foes, preventing those who had not yet been enslaved from falling into bondage. As for the rest of us who dwell within the bounds of the Pillars of Hercules, we were granted freedom in abundance.

However, in the course of time, after great earthquakes and devastating floods had come to pass, a day and night of great hardship descended upon us. On that fateful occasion, all the valiant forces that you possessed were swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis itself sank beneath the waves, vanishing from sight. Thus, even now, the sea there remains a place of mystery and despair, a treacherous expanse of mud, where the island once stood proud and resolute.

Indeed, Socrates, what has been said by the ancient Critias, as you have heard from the accounts of Solon, is quite remarkable. As I listened yesterday to your discourse on the state and the men you spoke of, I found myself marveling, recalling the very things I now express, and realizing that by some divine fortune, I have not strayed far from the many points Solon made. However, I did not wish to speak immediately, for my memory was not sufficiently clear.

I thus concluded that it would be necessary for me to gather my thoughts thoroughly before addressing you. Therefore, I hastily acknowledged the matters you presented yesterday, believing it to be of utmost importance to propose a discourse fitting to our intentions, which would, in moderation, lead us to prosperity.

So, as he stated, I departed from here yesterday, reflecting on these matters, and upon returning, I endeavored to recall everything from the night. Indeed, as you know, the teachings of children hold a remarkable significance. For what I heard yesterday, I cannot say if I could recall it all perfectly; yet, those things I have heard over many years would surely astonish me if I were to escape their grasp.

It was with great pleasure and youthful delight that I listened then, as the elder eagerly taught me, often prompting me with questions, so that the impressions became as indelible as the marks of an unwashable inscription. And indeed, I spoke of these matters early this morning, so that they might flow easily in conversation with you.

Now, therefore, for the sake of all that has been said, I am ready to speak, Socrates, not only in summary but as I have heard it in detail. As for the citizens and the city you described to us yesterday as if in a myth, we shall now bring forth the truth, establishing that this city indeed exists, and those citizens we shall declare to be our true ancestors, as the priest mentioned.

Certainly, we shall align our accounts and shall not deviate, asserting that they are those who existed in that time. Collectively, we shall strive to present what is fitting to the best of our abilities, as you have commanded us to deliver. Therefore, it is necessary, Socrates, to consider whether this discourse aligns with our understanding, or if we should seek another in its place.

Socrates:

And who, dear Critias, should we rather take as our guide in this matter, one who would be most fitting to speak of the present sacrifice to the deity, given its significance, and to provide not a fabricated myth but a true account? For how else shall we discover others if we abandon these? It is not possible; rather, we must speak of you, while I, in place of yesterday's discourse, shall now listen in silence.

Critias:

Consider, then, the arrangement we have made regarding the foreign matters, Socrates, as we have set them forth. For it seemed to us that Timaeus, being the most knowledgeable among us in astronomy and having crafted a work concerning the nature of the universe, should begin by speaking of the creation of the cosmos and conclude with the nature of humanity. Following him, I, having received from him the account of how humans came to be through his discourse, shall present those who have been educated by you, differing from them in various respects, and according to the words and laws of Solon, we shall introduce them as judges, making citizens of this city, as they were the Athenians of that time, whom the sacred writings have declared to be obscure. The remaining matters shall pertain to the citizens and the Athenians, as we shall now speak of them.

Socrates:

It seems fitting and splendid that the hearth of our discourse should be thus established. Therefore, it is your task to speak next, Timaeus, as it appears, calling upon the gods in accordance with the law.

Timaeus:

But, Socrates, indeed all those who partake, even slightly, in wisdom, always call upon the gods in every endeavor, whether great or small. As for us, who are about to craft the discourse concerning the whole, whether it is noble or ignoble, if we do not entirely deviate from the truth, we must necessarily invoke the gods and goddesses, praying to them with reason, especially for those matters, while we shall speak in accordance with our own understanding. And let the matters concerning the gods be thus invoked; as for our own, we shall call upon you in the manner that you may learn most easily, while I shall endeavor to indicate what I consider most fitting regarding the subjects at hand.

It is, then, my belief that we must first distinguish these matters: what is that which is always being, yet has no genesis, and what is that which is always becoming, yet is never truly being? The former can be comprehended through reason, always existing in the same state, while the latter is perceived through sensation, subject to opinion, ever becoming and perishing, but never truly existing.

Moreover, everything that comes into being must necessarily arise from some cause; for it is impossible for anything to come into existence without a cause. Therefore, whatever the creator looks upon, aiming to maintain the same state, must necessarily take as a model something that is eternal and unchanging, thus producing beauty. Conversely, whatever is brought into existence, if it is modeled after something that is transient, cannot be considered beautiful.

Now, the whole universe—whether we call it the cosmos or by any other name that might be most fitting—let us first examine it, considering what underlies all things. We must inquire whether it has always existed, having no beginning of generation, or whether it has come into being, starting from some origin. It has indeed come into being, for it is visible, tangible, and possesses a body; all such things are perceptible, and those that are perceptible are subject to opinion and are seen as becoming and generated.

Thus, we assert that whatever has come into being must necessarily arise from some cause. It is impossible to identify the creator and father of this whole without acknowledging that it is difficult to define. We must also consider which of the models the creator employed in crafting it—whether he aimed at the eternal and unchanging or at the transient. If this world is beautiful and the creator is good, it is evident that he looked toward the eternal; but if it is not, then it must be modeled after the transient.

It is clear that the eternal is the most evident, for the most beautiful of all that has come into being is the best of all causes. Thus, having been generated, it is comprehensible through reason and thought, and it has been created in a state of permanence. Given these conditions, it is necessary that this world be an image of something.

It is of utmost importance to begin with the nature of the original cause. Therefore, we must define both the image and the model itself, so that the discourses, which are their interpreters, may be seen as related. The former is permanent, stable, and manifest through reason—unchanging and indestructible, as far as it is possible for it to be so, and it must lack nothing. The latter, however, is modeled after that which is, and is an image of it, existing in accordance with those principles: that which pertains to generation is substance, while that which pertains to belief is truth.

Therefore, Socrates, if we are unable to fully comprehend the many matters concerning the gods and the generation of the universe, do not be surprised if we cannot provide you with perfectly precise and agreed-upon accounts. However, if we do not fall short in our representations, we must love the truth, remembering that we, the judges, possess a human nature, and thus, regarding these matters, it is fitting for us to accept the plausible myth without seeking anything further.

Socrates:

Excellent, Timaeus. Indeed, we must accept your introduction wholeheartedly. Now, please proceed to elaborate on the law.

Timaeus:

Let us speak, then, of the reason for the generation of this whole cosmos that the creator has established. He was good, and no one ever feels envy toward that which is good. Therefore, being outside of this goodness, he desired that all things should become as similar to himself as possible. This desire for the generation of the cosmos is, indeed, the most authoritative beginning that wise men might accept.

For the deity, wishing for all things to be good and for nothing to be base, took all that was visible and, instead of allowing it to remain in chaotic motion, brought it into order from disorder, believing that this would be better. It is fitting that the best should do nothing but the most beautiful. Thus, reasoning through this, he found that among all the visible things, nothing could be more beautiful than a whole that possesses reason. Yet, reason cannot exist without a soul.

Through this reasoning, he established the mind within the soul and the soul within the body, creating the whole in such a way that it would be the most beautiful and the best work. Therefore, according to this reasoning, we must say that this cosmos is a living being, endowed with soul and reason, brought into existence through the providence of the deity.

Now, having established this, we must next discuss to which of the living beings the creator has made it similar. Let us not assign any of the parts to any particular kind, for nothing that is incomplete could ever be considered beautiful. However, among the other living beings, let us assert that this one is most similar to the whole. For all intelligible living beings contain within themselves that which the cosmos has established, just as this cosmos encompasses all other visible beings.

Thus, desiring to make this living being the most beautiful and most perfect, the deity created it as a single visible entity, containing within itself all those beings that are naturally akin to it. Therefore, should we rightly call it one universe, or would it be more correct to say that there are many and infinite ones? It is one, if it is to be created according to the model. For that which contains all intelligible beings cannot be second to another; for it would then have to be another living being, of which it would be a part, and it could no longer be said to be that which contains all.

Thus, in order for this to be similar to the complete living being, the creator made not two nor countless worlds, but this one, unique and singular universe, which has come into being and will continue to be.

The generated being must indeed be corporeal, visible, and tangible. Without the element of fire, nothing could ever be seen, nor could anything be tangible without some solid substance, and solid matter cannot exist without earth. Thus, the deity fashioned the body of the cosmos from fire and earth.

It is not possible for two things to be beautifully constituted without a third to bind them together; for there must be some kind of bond that brings both together. The most beautiful bond is that which makes itself and the things joined to it as one as possible, and this is naturally the most harmonious. Whenever there are three numbers, whether in volumes or powers, if the middle one is such that it is to the first as the first is to the last, and again, the last to the middle and the middle to the first, then the middle becomes both first and last, while the last and the first become both middle. Thus, it follows that all these must necessarily be the same, and whatever has come into being will be one with respect to each other.

If, therefore, the body of the cosmos were flat and had no depth, a single middle would suffice to connect both itself and the other parts. But now, since it must be solid, it cannot be one; rather, two must always be joined by a middle. Thus, the deity placed water and air in the middle of fire and earth, arranging them in such a way as was possible according to the same reasoning: that fire relates to air, air to water, and water to earth. He thus created a visible and tangible heaven.

From these elements, and through the number four, the body of the cosmos was generated through a harmonious relationship, possessing a friendship among them, so that they might come together into one, unbroken by anything else except by the bond that unites them.

Each of the four elements contributed one whole to the composition of the cosmos. For the creator established it from fire, water, air, and earth, leaving no part or power outside of these. He thought it necessary that it should be a complete living being made from complete parts, and that it should be one, as nothing should be left out from which another such being could arise. Furthermore, he aimed for it to be ageless and free from disease, recognizing that a composite body, surrounded by strong forces, would be subject to decay and illness, leading to aging and decline.

Thus, through this reasoning and the logic behind it, he created one whole from all, perfect, ageless, and free from disease. He gave it a form that was appropriate and related. For a living being that is to contain all within itself, it would be fitting for it to have a shape that encompasses all forms. Therefore, he fashioned it as a sphere, equidistant from the center to all its extremities, making it circular, the most complete and similar shape to itself, believing it to be the most beautiful of all shapes.

Thus, everything outside of it was made smooth and round for the sake of many. For it needed no eyes, as nothing visible remained outside of it, nor ears, for there was nothing to be heard. There was no breath surrounding it that required inhalation, nor was there any need for an organ to receive nourishment or to expel waste. It did not lack anything from outside—indeed, it provided its own nourishment, experiencing everything within itself and through itself, having come into being through art. The creator believed that it would be better for it to be self-sufficient than to depend on others.

As for hands, there was no need for it to grasp or defend itself; he thought it unnecessary to attach them. Nor was there any need for feet or any service related to standing. For he assigned it its own natural motion, particularly the seven movements related to mind and reason. Therefore, he caused it to move in a circular motion, revolving around itself, eliminating all other movements and crafting it to be unerring. Thus, in this cycle, it was born without the need for feet, being self-sufficient and complete.

Verily, this is the reasoning of the divine, ever present and eternal, concerning the God that shall one day come to be. Thus, He conceived a being that is smooth and even, equal and whole in every aspect, fashioned from perfect bodies. He placed the soul in its very center, extending it throughout, and enveloped the body from without, establishing a singular, solitary heaven that revolves in a circle. By virtue of His excellence, He was able to unite with Himself, lacking the need for any other, and thus He became known and beloved unto Himself. Through all these things, He brought forth a most blessed God.

As for the soul, we do not now endeavor to speak of it as we do in later times; rather, the divine fashioned a newer soul— for it would not have permitted an elder to be governed by a younger. Yet, in our great participation in what is present, we speak in this manner, while He, in both generation and virtue, established a soul that is prior and elder, as the master and ruler of the body, from which all things commence.

From the indivisible and ever-constant essence, and the essence that is divisible concerning bodies, He blended a third kind of essence in the midst, combining the nature of the one and that of the other. Thus, He constituted them according to the same principles, within the realm of the indivisible and the divisible concerning bodies. Taking these three essences, He fused them into one singular form, harmonizing the disparate nature into a unified whole by force.

Having mingled with the essence and formed one from three, He then apportioned this entirety into the various fates that were fitting, each one being a mixture of the same, the other, and the essence. He began to divide in this manner: first, He took one portion from all, then He removed a double portion of that, and the third was a half of the second, thrice the first, the fourth being double the second, the fifth thrice the third, the sixth being eight times the first, and the seventh being twenty-seven times the first. After this, He filled in the doubled and tripled intervals, cutting portions from beyond and placing them in between, so that in each interval there were two means, one exceeding the ends and the other equal in number.

Thus, with the means of halves, thirds, and sixths being formed from these bonds in the previous intervals, the entirety of the triplet was filled in by the sixth interval, leaving each portion of that interval with a count of six, fifty, and two hundred, in relation to three, forty, and two hundred. And thus, the mixture from which these were cut was now wholly consumed. Therefore, this entire composition, having been split in twain along its length, was bent into one circle, as if a hand had pressed upon it, joining itself and one another in the direct opposition of the impact, and in the same manner, it moved around itself, creating the outer and inner circles.

Thus, the outer motion was declared to be of the same nature, while the inner was of another. The outer was guided along the side to the right, while the inner traversed the diameter to the left, granting strength to the motion of the same and similar nature. For He allowed it to remain undivided, while the inner was split into seven unequal circles according to the dimensions of the double and triple intervals, each being three in number, directing the circles in opposition to one another, yet moving three alike, while the four moved differently in relation to the three, all carried forth in reason.

When, therefore, all the constitution of the soul came to be through the mind of the Creator, thereafter all that is corporeal was extended within it, and gathering the center in the midst, He fitted it together. The soul, having been woven from the center to the outermost heaven, enveloped it in a circular form, and while revolving within itself, it commenced a divine principle of an everlasting and rational life throughout all time. Thus, the body became a visible heaven, while the soul remained invisible, partaking of reason and harmony, becoming the finest of all that is generated by the best of the intelligible beings.

For, being composed of the same and the other nature, and from these three essences, it was bound by fate, and according to reason, it was divided and connected. The soul, revolving towards itself, when it touches something that is scattered, and when it is indivisible, speaks, moving through all of itself, whenever it is the same and whenever it is different, concerning what it is most of all, and where, and how, and when it happens, according to the occurrences, each being and suffering in relation to those that are the same.

The discourse that arises from the same is true, concerning both the other being and the same, carried forth in the moving being by itself, without sound or echo. When it pertains to the sensible, and the circle of the other is upright, it proclaims throughout its entire soul, and thus beliefs and opinions become firm and true. But when it pertains to the rational, and the circle of the same is well-rounded, it necessarily results in intellect and knowledge. In this way, when beings come into existence, if anyone should speak of anything other than the soul, it would declare all the more that which is true.

As it was moved and living, the father who begot it perceived it as a statue of the eternal gods, and he was filled with joy and delight, conceiving yet again to create something more akin to the original model. Thus, as it happens to be an eternal living being, so too did he endeavor to bring forth this whole into a similar power. The nature of the living being was indeed eternal, and it was not possible for the creator to attach it wholly to himself; yet, he conceived to create a movable being of eternity, and while adorning the heavens, he made a lasting image of eternity, which we have named time.

For days and nights and months and years, which did not exist before the heavens came to be, were then brought into being along with them, as they were established. All these are parts of time, and that which was, that which is, and that which shall be, are forms that we carry, yet we do not rightly perceive them in relation to the eternal essence. For we say that it was, it is, and it shall be, yet only that which is pertains to the true discourse; that which was and that which shall be ought to be spoken of concerning the generation in time— for there are movements, and that which always remains the same does not pertain to becoming older or younger through time, nor does it ever come to be or has ever been, nor shall it ever be again. All that pertains to generation is not attached to those in sensation, but rather these things have come to be as time mimics eternity and revolves according to number— and in addition to these, there are such matters as that which has come to be is indeed that which has come to be, and that which is becoming is indeed becoming, and that which shall come to be is indeed to come to be, and that which is not is indeed not. Of these, we speak nothing precise.

Concerning these matters, it would not be fitting to take the time to elaborate in the present moment.

Thus, time came to be alongside the heavens, that they might be born together and, should there ever be a dissolution, they might also be released together. This was in accordance with the model of eternal nature, so that it might be most similar to it in power; for indeed, the model is the essence of all eternity, while time itself has come to be, exists, and shall be through its end.

From the divine reason and thought, such as this, time was generated, and thus the sun, the moon, and five other stars, known as wandering bodies, were created for the purpose of defining and safeguarding the numbers of time. The Creator fashioned the bodies of each of these celestial beings and set them into their respective orbits, which the other bodies were to traverse. There are seven in total: the moon in the first orbit around the earth, the sun in the second above the earth, and the morning star along with the sacred Hermes, moving swiftly in a circle equal to that of the sun, while the opposing force was held by it. Hence, they both encompass and are encompassed by one another— the sun, Hermes, and the morning star.

As for the others, for which reasons they were established, if one were to examine all, the discourse would be more than sufficient to provide an account of the reasons for their existence. These matters, therefore, might well be recounted later in due course. When each had arrived at its fitting orbit, as was necessary for the workings of time, living beings were born, bound by the ties of life, and they learned what was commanded. Thus, in the course of the other orbit, which was lateral, through the same orbit that was moving and holding, the greater of them moved in one circle, while the lesser moved in another, the lesser moving more swiftly, while the greater moved more slowly.

In the same orbit, those moving most swiftly appeared to be overtaken by those moving more slowly; for all their circles, turning in a spiral, advanced in opposite directions, while the slowest departed from itself most swiftly, revealing itself closest to the fastest. To serve as a clear measure of the relative slowness and swiftness, and concerning the eight orbits, the deity kindled light in the second of the orbits towards the earth, which we now call the sun, so that it might illuminate the heavens as much as possible, sharing the number of living beings that were fitting, having learned from the same and similar orbit.

Thus, night and day came to be, through this, as the period of the one and most rational revolution. When the moon, having completed its own circle, overtakes the sun, it marks the year whenever the sun completes its own circle. Yet, the periods of the other celestial bodies are not well understood by men, save for a few among the many, who neither name them nor measure them against one another, seeking to understand them through numbers. Thus, to speak plainly, they do not know the time of their wandering, being filled with multitude and wondrously adorned. Nevertheless, it is still possible to perceive that the perfect number of time fulfills the complete year when all eight periods, having been combined, attain the head of the circle of the same and similar motion.

For these reasons, the stars were born, traversing the heavens, so that they might be as similar as possible to the perfect and intelligible living being, in imitation of the nature of eternity.

And thus, all else had already been fashioned until the generation of time into a likeness of that which was to be represented, yet not all living beings had yet been contained within itself; it still held some dissimilarity. This remnant was being shaped towards the nature of the archetype. Just as the mind perceives the ideas of what constitutes a living being, so too did it conceive that there should be such and so many forms.

Indeed, there are four kinds: one is the celestial race of the gods, another is the winged and aerial, the third is the aquatic form, and the fourth is the terrestrial and land-dwelling. The divine essence was fashioned primarily from fire, so that it might be the brightest and fairest to behold. In all things, it was made to resemble the perfect circle, placing it in accordance with the highest wisdom, surrounding the heavens with a true cosmos, adorned in its entirety.

To each, it assigned two motions: one, in the same manner, revolving around itself, always contemplating the same things; the other, moving forward, held by the same and similar orbit. The five motions were made stationary and fixed, so that each might become as excellent as possible. From this cause arose the unerring celestial beings, divine and eternal, always revolving in the same manner: while those that wander and hold such a course, as previously mentioned, came to be in accordance with those.

The earth, our nurturing mother, was stretched around the axis that is ever-present, and the Creator devised it as a guardian and maker of both night and day, the first and eldest of the gods that have come to be within the heavens. These beings dance and mirror one another, and concerning the revolutions of the circles among themselves, in their interconnections, how the gods are born from one another and how many face each other, with whom they cover one another in time, each being concealed and then reappearing, sending forth fears and signs of what shall come to be to those unable to reason, for to speak of these imitations without sight would be a vain toil. But let these matters, and those concerning the visible and generated gods, have their conclusion in nature.

As for the other spirits, to speak of and to know their generation is greater than concerning ourselves; we must trust the words spoken before, for they are said to be offspring of the gods, and surely they know their own ancestors. Therefore, it is impossible to disbelieve the children of the gods, even though they speak without images and necessary proofs, but as if they were speaking of their own kin, we ought to believe them in accordance with the law. Thus, let the generation of these gods be spoken of and known to us.

From Earth and Heaven were born Oceanus and Tethys, and from them came Phorcys, Cronus, Rhea, and all those who followed after. From Cronus and Rhea came Zeus, Hera, and all those known as their brothers, as well as others born of them. Since all those who wander openly and those who appear as they wish have held a generation of the gods, this one who has generated all things speaks thus to them:
